### **40. What is the Barcode Scanner control, and how do you integrate it?**

*   **What it is:** A control that uses the device's camera to **scan barcodes and QR codes**, returning the scanned data as text.
*   **Important Note:** This control only works on **mobile devices** running the Power Apps mobile app.
*   **Integration Steps:**
    *   **Step 1:** Insert a **Barcode Scanner** control from the **"Input"** menu.
    *   **Step 2: Configure the `OnScan` Property:** This formula runs after a successful scan. The scanned data is available in `BarcodeScanner.Value`.
    *   **Common `OnScan` Logic:**
        *   **Look Up a Product:** `Set( varScannedItem, LookUp( Products, BarcodeID = BarcodeScanner1.Value ) )`
        *   **Navigate to a Detail Screen:** `If( Not IsBlank(varScannedItem), Navigate(DetailScreen, ScreenTransition.None) )`
        *   **Add to a List:** `Collect( ScannedItems, { Barcode: BarcodeScanner1.Value, Time: Now() } )`
    *   **Step 3: Add a Trigger:** Typically, you add a button labeled "Scan" that sets the scanner's `Visible` property to `true` and starts the camera. The `OnScan` property automatically fires when a code is detected.
