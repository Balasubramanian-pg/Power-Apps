### **31. How do you create a custom component in Power Apps?**

*   **What it is:** A **custom component** is a reusable set of controls with their own properties and logic, similar to a function in programming. Create once, use many times.
*   **Creation Steps:**
    *   **Step 1: Insert Component:** Go to the **"Insert"** tab, click the **"Component"** dropdown, and select **"New component"**.
    *   **Step 2: Design the UI:** A new component canvas opens. **Add controls** (text inputs, labels, icons, etc.) just like you would on a screen.
    *   **Step 3: Define Custom Properties:** This is the key to making components dynamic.
        *   In the **"Properties"** pane on the right, click **"New custom property"**.
        *   Give it a name (e.g., `DisplayText`), choose a type (**Input**, **Output**, or **Data**), and a data type (Text, Number, etc.).
        *   **Input Properties** pass data *into* the component.
        *   **Output Properties** pass data *out of* the component (e.g., when it's clicked).
    *   **Step 4: Bind Properties:** Connect your component's internal controls to the custom properties.
        *   Example: Set a **Label's** `Text` property to `Component.DisplayText` to show whatever text is passed into the component.
    *   **Step 5: Save and Use:** Click the checkmark to save. The component now appears in the "Custom components" library. Drag and drop it onto any screen.
