### **32. What is a form control, and how do you use EditForm() and DisplayForm()?**

*   **What it is:** The **Form** control is a container specifically designed for creating, viewing, and editing records from a data source. It automatically generates fields based on your data source's schema.
*   **EditForm():**
    *   **Purpose:** Used for **creating new records** or **editing existing ones**.
    *   **Setup:**
        1.  Insert an **Edit Form** control.
        2.  Set its **`DataSource`** property (e.g., `SharePointList`).
        3.  Use the **"Edit fields"** pane to add and arrange the data cards (fields) you want users to edit.
        4.  Set the form's **`Mode`** property:
            *   **`FormMode.New`**: For creating a record.
            *   **`FormMode.Edit`**: For editing an existing record. You must set the **`Item`** property to the record to edit (e.g., `Gallery1.Selected`).
        5.  Use **`SubmitForm(FormName)`** in a button's `OnSelect` to save changes.
*   **DisplayForm():**
    *   **Purpose:** Used for **read-only viewing** of a single record. Users cannot edit the data.
    *   **Setup:**
        1.  Insert a **Display Form** control.
        2.  Set its **`DataSource`** and **`Item`** properties (e.g., `Gallery1.Selected`).
        3.  Use the **"Edit fields"** pane to choose which fields to display.
    *   **Key Difference:** There is no `SubmitForm()` for a Display Form, as no data is saved.
