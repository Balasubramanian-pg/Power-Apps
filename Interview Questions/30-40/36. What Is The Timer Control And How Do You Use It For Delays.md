### **36. What is the Timer control, and how do you use it for delays?**

*   **What it is:** The **Timer** control runs in the background and can trigger actions at set intervals or after a delay.
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   **`Duration`**: How long the timer runs for (in milliseconds). E.g., `5000` for 5 seconds.
    *   **`AutoStart`**: If `true`, the timer starts as soon as the screen loads.
    *   **`Repeat`**: If `true`, the timer restarts automatically after it finishes.
    *   **`OnTimerEnd`**: The formula that runs when the timer completes its `Duration`.
*   **Use Case: Creating a Delay/Splash Screen:**
    1.  On a "Splash" screen, add a Timer.
    2.  Set `Duration` to `3000` (3 seconds) and `AutoStart` to `true`.
    3.  Set the `OnTimerEnd` property to `Navigate(HomeScreen)`.
    4.  The app will automatically navigate to the home screen after 3 seconds.
