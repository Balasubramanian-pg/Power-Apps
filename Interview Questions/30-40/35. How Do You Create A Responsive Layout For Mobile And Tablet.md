### **35. How do you create a responsive layout for mobile and tablet?**

*   **Core Principle:** Use containers and relative positioning instead of fixed X/Y coordinates.
*   **Key Techniques:**
    *   **Use Container Controls:** **Vertical and Horizontal Containers** are the foundation of responsive design. They automatically arrange child controls.
    *   **Set Sizing to "Fit to contents" or "Fill remaining space":** This allows controls to grow and shrink based on screen size and available space.
    *   **Use `App.Width` and `App.Height`:**
        *   Set a container's **`Width`** to `App.Width` and **`Height`** to `App.Height` to make it fill the screen.
        *   Use formulas for dynamic sizing: `App.Width * 0.8` for 80% of the screen width.
    *   **Use `Min`/`Max` Values:** Set a control's **`MinWidth`**, **`MaxWidth`**, **`MinHeight`**, and **`MaxHeight`** to prevent it from becoming too small or too large.
    *   **Reorder Content:** Use the **`Layout`** property on containers to change from horizontal to vertical arrangement on smaller screens.
    *   **Show/Hide Controls:** Use the **`Visible`** property with screen size checks (e.g., `If(App.Width < 600, false, true)`) to show simplified UI on mobile.
