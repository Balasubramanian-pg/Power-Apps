### **60. How do you use Azure Functions with Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** Azure Functions allow you to run custom server-side code. You can call this code from Power Apps to perform complex calculations, data processing, or interact with other services that aren't natively supported.
*   **Integration Method:** You create a **Custom Connector** for your Azure Function.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Create the Azure Function:** Develop your function in Azure and ensure it has an HTTP trigger. It should return a well-defined JSON response.
    2.  **Get the OpenAPI Definition:** The easiest way is to have your Azure Function generate an **OpenAPI (Swagger) definition**.
    3.  **Create a Custom Connector:** In Power Apps, create a new custom connector and **import the OpenAPI file** from your function. This will automatically define the actions, requests, and responses.
    4.  **Configure Security:** Set up the authentication for your connector (e.g., **API Key** – where the key is your Function key – or **OAuth 2.0**).
    5.  **Use in Power App:** Add the custom connector as a data source in your app and call it like any other function: `MyAzureFunctionConnector.MyAction( InputParameter )`
