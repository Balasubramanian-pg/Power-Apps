### **57. How do you embed a Power App in SharePoint?**

*   **Method:** Use the **Power Apps web part** in a modern SharePoint Online page.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Edit a SharePoint Page:** Navigate to the SharePoint site page where you want the app and click **"Edit"**.
    2.  **Add the Web Part:** Click the **"+"** button to add a new web part.
    3.  **Select Power Apps:** Select the **"Power Apps"** web part from the list.
    4.  **Configure the App:**
        *   In the web part pane on the right, you have two options:
            *   **Select an existing app:** Choose an app from your Power Apps environment.
            *   **Create a new app:** Launches the Power Apps studio to create an app that will be linked to this page.
    5.  **Pass Context (Advanced):** You can use the **`PowerApps`** parameter in the page's URL or the web part properties to pass information (like an `ID`) from SharePoint to the embedded app, allowing the app to filter its view based on the page it's on.
