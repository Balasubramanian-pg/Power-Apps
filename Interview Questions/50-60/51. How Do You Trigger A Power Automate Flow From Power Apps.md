### **51. How do you trigger a Power Automate flow from Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** You can call a Power Automate flow as an action from within your canvas app, allowing you to leverage complex workflows, integrations, and server-side logic.
*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   You must have a **Power Automate flow** that uses the **"Power Apps" trigger**.
    *   You need the appropriate permissions to both the app and the flow.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Create the Flow:** In Power Automate, create a new flow and select the **"Power Apps" trigger**.
    2.  **Add Actions:** Build your flow with the necessary actions (e.g., send an email, update a database, post to a Teams channel).
    3.  **Define Inputs (Optional):** Use the **"Ask in Power Apps"** dynamic content in your flow actions to define parameters that the app will pass to the flow.
    4.  **Save the Flow.**
    5.  **Connect in Power Apps:** In your app, go to the **Data sources** pane and **"Add data source"**. Find and add your flow under the **"Power Automate"** tab.
    6.  **Trigger the Flow:** Use the flow like a function. Typically, you call it from a **Button's `OnSelect`** property: `YourFlowName.Run( InputParameter1, InputParameter2 )`
