### **58. How do you use Power Apps Portals for external users?**

*   **What it is:** **Power Apps Portals** (now part of Power Pages) provides a framework for creating **external-facing websites** that allow users outside your organization to interact with data stored in Dataverse, anonymously or through authentication.
*   **Primary Use Cases:** Customer self-service portals, partner communities, event registration sites, and application forms.
*   **How to Use It:**
    1.  **Provision a Portal:** In the Power Platform admin center, create a new Portal based on a starter template.
    2.  **Design the Portal:** Use the low-code **Portals Studio** to add and configure web pages, forms, lists, and other components.
    3.  **Configure Authentication:** Set up identity providers (like Azure AD B2C, Google, Microsoft Account) to allow external users to sign in.
    4.  **Configure Dataverse Security:** Create **Web Roles** and assign them to portal users. Configure **table permissions** to control exactly what data each role can Create, Read, Update, or Delete.
    5.  **Embed a Canvas App (Optional):** You can embed a canvas app directly on a portal webpage to provide a rich, custom interactive experience.
