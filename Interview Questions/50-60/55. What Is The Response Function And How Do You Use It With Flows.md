### **55. What is the Response function, and how do you use it with flows?**

*   **What it is:** In Power Apps, the **`Response`** object is returned by a Power Automate flow after it finishes running. It contains the output data sent back by the flow's **"Respond to a Power App"** action.
*   **How to Use It:**
    *   When you run a flow, it returns an object. You must **store this object in a variable** to access its data.
    *   **Syntax:** `Set( flowResult, MyFlow.Run() )`
    *   **Accessing Data:** The `Response` object contains the output fields you defined in the flow.
        *   **Example:** If your flow's "Respond to a Power App" action has outputs named `isSuccess` and `message`, you access them as:
            *   `flowResult.Response.isSuccess`
            *   `flowResult.Response.message`
    *   **Full Example:**
        ```powerfx
        // OnSelect of a button
        Set( varFlowOutput, ProcessDataFlow.Run( TextInput1.Text ) );
        If( varFlowOutput.Response.isSuccess = true,
            Notify( "Success: " & varFlowOutput.Response.message, Success ),
            Notify( "Error: " & varFlowOutput.Response.message, Error )
        )
        ```
