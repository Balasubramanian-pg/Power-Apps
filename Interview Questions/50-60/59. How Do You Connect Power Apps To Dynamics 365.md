### **59. How do you connect Power Apps to Dynamics 365?**

*   **Concept:** Dynamics 365 applications (like Sales and Customer Service) are built on top of **Dataverse**. Therefore, connecting to them is fundamentally the same as connecting to any other Dataverse table.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Add Data Source:** In your canvas or model-driven app, add a new data source and select **"Dataverse"**.
    2.  **Select Tables:** You will see a list of all tables in your environment. This includes both standard Dataverse tables *and* **Dynamics 365 tables** (e.g., Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Case).
    3.  **Use the Data:** Select the relevant Dynamics 365 tables. You can now use these tables in your app's galleries, forms, and formulas.
        *   **Example:** A canvas app for field service technicians could use the `Incident` (Case) table to display a list of assigned work orders.
