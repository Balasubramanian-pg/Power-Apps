### **53. How do you pass data from Power Apps to a flow?**

*   **Method:** You pass data as **input parameters** to the flow when you call it from Power Apps.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **In the Flow:** When using the **Power Apps trigger**, you define the input parameters by clicking **"Add an input"** and choosing a data type (Text, Number, File, etc.). These inputs become available as dynamic content in your flow.
    2.  **In Power Apps:** After adding the flow as a data source, the `Run` method of the flow will automatically require you to provide values for all the inputs you defined.
    3.  **Calling the Flow:** In your app's formula (e.g., a button's `OnSelect`), you pass the data by providing the values in the correct order.
        *   **Example:** `MyApprovalFlow.Run( TextInput_Title.Text, TextInput_Description.Text, Gallery1.Selected.ID )`
