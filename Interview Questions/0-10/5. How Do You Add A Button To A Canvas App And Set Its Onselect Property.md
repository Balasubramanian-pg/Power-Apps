### **5. How do you add a button to a canvas app and set its OnSelect property?**

*   **Adding the Button:**
    *   Go to the **"Insert"** tab in the ribbon.
    *   Expand the **"Input"** group (or use the search bar).
    *   Click on **"Button"**. This will place a button on your active screen.
*   **Setting the OnSelect Property:**
    *   Select the button you just added.
    *   In the **Formula Bar** at the top of the screen (or the Properties pane), find the **`OnSelect`** property.
    *   Enter the formula or action you want the button to perform. For example:
        *   **`Navigate(DetailScreen, ScreenTransition.Cover)`** to go to another screen.
        *   **`Patch(YourDataSource, ThisItem, {Status: "Approved"})`** to update a record.
        *   **`Set(UserName, TextInput1.Text)`** to set a variable.
    *   To test, hold the **Alt** key and click the button.
