### **7. How do you change the theme of a canvas app?**

*   **Step 1: Access Themes:** Go to the **"View"** tab in the ribbon and select **"Themes"**.
*   **Step 2: Choose a Theme:** A "Themes" pane will open on the right. You can select one of the pre-defined theme palettes (e.g., Sea, Sky, Rust).
*   **Step 3: Apply Theme:** Clicking a theme will **immediately apply** it to your entire app, changing the colors for all controls that use the theme colors.
*   **Step 4: Customize (Optional):** You can further customize the theme by clicking **"Customize theme"** at the bottom of the pane. Here you can change the **Accent color**, **Primary color**, **Font**, and more. These changes become your app's new default theme.
