### **8. What is a screen in Power Apps, and how do you navigate between screens?**

*   **What is a Screen:** A screen is the fundamental **container and layout element** in a canvas app, similar to a page in a website or a slide in a presentation. Each app is composed of one or more screens.
*   **Navigating Between Screens:**
    *   **To Navigate Forward:** Use the **`Navigate()`** function. This is typically set on the `OnSelect` property of a button or an icon.
        *   **Syntax:** `Navigate(ScreenName, TransitionType)`
        *   **Example:** `Navigate(DetailsScreen, ScreenTransition.Cover)`
    *   **To Navigate Back:** Use the **`Back()`** function. This mimics the browser's "back" button and returns the user to the previous screen they were on.
        *   **Example:** `Back()`
