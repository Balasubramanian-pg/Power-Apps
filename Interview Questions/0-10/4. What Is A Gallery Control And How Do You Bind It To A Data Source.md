### **4. What is a gallery control, and how do you bind it to a data source?**

*   **What it is:** A **gallery** is a container control designed to show a list of records from a data source. It creates a repeating pattern of controls (like labels and images) for each record in your data.
*   **How to Bind it:**
    *   **Step 1:** Add a gallery control from the **"Insert"** menu.
    *   **Step 2:** With the gallery selected, go to the **Properties pane** on the right.
    *   **Step 3:** Click on the **"Data source"** property.
    *   **Step 4:** Choose an existing data source from the list or click **"Add data source"** to connect to a new one (e.g., SharePoint list, Excel table).
    *   **Step 5:** Once a data source is selected, the gallery will automatically populate with sample data. You can then customize the layout and the individual controls within the gallery template.
