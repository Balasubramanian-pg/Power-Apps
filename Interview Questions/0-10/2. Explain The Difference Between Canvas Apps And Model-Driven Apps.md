### **2. Explain the difference between canvas apps and model-driven apps.**

*   **Canvas Apps:**
    *   **Design Philosophy:** Start with a **blank canvas**, giving the developer complete control over the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
    *   **UI Flexibility:** You drag and drop controls (like text boxes, buttons, galleries) onto the screen and place them anywhere you want, similar to designing a PowerPoint slide.
    *   **Data Sources:** Can connect to a **wide variety** of data sources (SharePoint, SQL, Excel, Dataverse, etc.) simultaneously in a single app.
    *   **Primary Use Case:** Best for **task-specific, pixel-perfect applications**, especially mobile apps or apps that require a unique, highly customized interface.
*   **Model-Driven Apps:**
    *   **Design Philosophy:** Start with your **data model** (defined in Dataverse). The UI is largely generated automatically based on your data, forms, views, and business processes.
    *   **UI Structure:** The layout is more **structured and responsive by default**. You customize predefined components like forms, views, charts, and dashboards rather than placing individual controls.
    *   **Data Source:** Primarily and most powerfully built on top of the **Microsoft Dataverse**.
    *   **Primary Use Case:** Best for **complex business applications** that require rich relational data, strong security, and process-driven workflows (e.g., a case management system, a sales pipeline tracker).
