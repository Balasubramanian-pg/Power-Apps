### **10. What is the difference between Label and Text Input controls?**

*   **Label Control:**
    *   **Primary Purpose:** Used for **displaying static or dynamic text that is read-only**. The user cannot change the text directly.
    *   **Data Binding:** Often used to display data from a record (e.g., `ThisItem.Title` in a gallery) or the result of a formula (e.g., `"Hello, " & User.FullName`).
    *   **Common Use Cases:** Titles, descriptions, data fields in a view-only form, calculated results.
*   **Text Input Control:**
    *   **Primary Purpose:** Used as a **field for users to type in and provide data**. It is an interactive, editable control.
    *   **Data Binding:** Used in forms for **data entry and editing**. Its `Text` property is typically patched back to a data source.
    *   **Common Use Cases:** Search boxes, form fields for name/email/description, any scenario requiring user input.
