### **6. What is the purpose of the Tree View in Power Apps Studio?**

*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The Tree View provides a **hierarchical, visual representation** of all the elements (screens and controls) in your app.
*   **Primary Purposes:**
    *   **Navigation & Selection:** Easily select controls that might be hidden behind others or are too small to click on the canvas.
    *   **Understanding Parent-Child Relationships:** Clearly see which controls are inside other containers (like Galleries, Forms, or Groups).
    *   **Renaming Elements:** You can easily rename screens and controls by right-clicking on them in the Tree View, which is a critical best practice.
    *   **Organizing Elements:** You can drag and drop elements within the Tree View to reorder them or change their parent container.
