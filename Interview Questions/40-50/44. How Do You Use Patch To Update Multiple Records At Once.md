### **44. How do you use Patch() to update multiple records at once?**

*   **Concept:** While `Patch()` is designed for a single record, you can use it inside a **`ForAll()`** function to update multiple records in a single operation.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Identify the **collection or gallery** containing the records you want to update (e.g., `Filter(Products, IsSelected=true)`).
    2.  Use **`ForAll()`** to iterate over this table.
    3.  Inside `ForAll()`, use **`Patch()`** for each record (`ThisRecord`).
*   **Example: Bulk Updating Status:**
    ```powerfx
    ForAll(
        Filter( Products, IsSelected = true ),
        Patch(
            Products, // The data source
            ThisRecord, // The specific record to update from the filtered list
            { Status: "Discontinued" } // The change to apply
        )
    )
    ```
*   **Important Note:** This formula will send one `PATCH` request to the data source for *each* record in the filtered list. It is not a single SQL-style "UPDATE WHERE" command, but it executes all updates in one seamless action from the user's perspective.
