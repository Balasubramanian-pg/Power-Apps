### **50. How do you use Concurrent() to run multiple functions in parallel?**

*   **Purpose:** The **`Concurrent()`** function allows you to run multiple formulas **at the same time (in parallel)**, rather than one after the other (sequentially). This can significantly improve performance when loading data from multiple, independent sources.
*   **Syntax:** `Concurrent( Formula1, Formula2, ..., [ContextVariable] )`
*   **How it Works:** Power Apps normally processes formulas sequentially. `Concurrent` tells it to start all the enclosed formulas simultaneously and wait for all of them to finish.
*   **Example: Loading Multiple Collections on App Start:**
    *   **Without Concurrent (Sequential - Slower):**
        ```powerfx
        ClearCollect( colProducts, Products );
        ClearCollect( colCustomers, Customers );
        ClearCollect( colOrders, Orders );
        // Each line waits for the previous to finish
        ```
    *   **With Concurrent (Parallel - Faster):**
        ```powerfx
        Concurrent(
            ClearCollect( colProducts, Products ),
            ClearCollect( colCustomers, Customers ),
            ClearCollect( colOrders, Orders )
        )
        // All three ClearCollect operations start at the same time
        ```
*   **Important Limitation:** The formulas inside `Concurrent` **cannot depend on each other's results**. They must be independent operations for it to work correctly.
