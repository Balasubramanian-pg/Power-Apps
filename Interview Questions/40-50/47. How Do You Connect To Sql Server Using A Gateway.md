### **47. How do you connect to SQL Server using a gateway?**

*   **Concept:** An **on-premises data gateway** acts as a bridge, allowing cloud services like Power Apps to securely access data located within a private corporate network (like a local SQL Server).
*   **Setup Process:**
    1.  **Install and Configure the Gateway:** Download and install the gateway on a machine that is always on and can access your SQL Server. Configure it with a gateway "cloud service".
    2.  **Add SQL Server as a Data Source in Power Platform:**
        *   Go to the Power Platform Admin Center.
        *   Navigate to **Data > Gateways** and select your gateway.
        *   Click **"Add Data Source"**, choose **"SQL Server"**, and enter the **Server name**, **Database name**, and **Authentication method** (usually Windows or SQL authentication).
    3.  **Connect from Power Apps:**
        *   In your app, go to **View > Data sources > Add data source**.
        *   Search for the **"SQL Server"** connector.
        *   A dialog will appear. Select your gateway and then the specific data source you configured in the previous step.
    4.  **Use the Data:** Once connected, you can use the SQL Server tables in your app just like any other data source (e.g., in galleries, forms, and `Patch()` statements).
