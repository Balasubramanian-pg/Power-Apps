### **49. How do you implement row-level security in a model-driven app?**

*   **Concept:** **Row-level security** ensures users can only see and interact with the data they are permitted to. This is a feature of the underlying **Dataverse**, not the app itself.
*   **Implementation Process:**
    1.  **Define Security Roles:** In the Power Platform Admin Center, go to your environment and navigate to **Settings > Security > Security Roles**.
    2.  **Create a Role:** Create a new security role (e.g., "Regional Manager").
    3.  **Set Permissions:** On the **"Core Records"** tab, set the **Read, Write, Create, Delete** permissions for the relevant tables. You can set this to **User** (own records), **Business Unit**, **Parent: Child Business Units**, or **Organization** (all records).
    4.  **Implement Data Filtering (for custom logic):** For more complex rules (e.g., a user can only see projects in their region), you use **Azure Active Directory (AAD) Groups** and **Power Automate flows** or **custom plugins** to automatically assign records to users/groups based on criteria.
    5.  **Assign Roles to Users:** Finally, assign the security roles you created to the appropriate users or AAD groups.
*   **Result:** When a user opens a model-driven app (or a canvas app using Dataverse), they will automatically only see the data permitted by their assigned security roles.
