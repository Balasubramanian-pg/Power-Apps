### **41. How do you use GroupBy() to aggregate data?**

*   **Purpose:** The **`GroupBy()`** function restructures a table by grouping records that share a common value in a specified column. It creates a new table where each row represents a unique group and contains a nested table of the original records.
*   **Syntax:** `GroupBy( Table, ColumnName, GroupName )`
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Specify the source table** you want to group.
    2.  **Name the column** you want to group by (e.g., `"Department"`).
    3.  **Provide a name** for the column in the new table that will hold the nested records (e.g., `"Employees"`).
*   **Example:**
    *   **Source Data:** A list of employees with `Name` and `Department`.
    *   **Formula:** `GroupBy( Employees, "Department", "DepartmentEmployees" )`
    *   **Result:** A new table with two columns:
        *   **`Department`**: Contains the unique department names (e.g., "Sales", "Marketing").
        *   **`DepartmentEmployees`**: Contains a *table* of all employees belonging to that department.
*   **Using the Result:** You can now use this grouped data in a gallery. Set the gallery's `Items` to the grouped collection, and then display `ThisItem.Department` and use `CountRows(ThisItem.DepartmentEmployees)` to show the number of people in each department.
