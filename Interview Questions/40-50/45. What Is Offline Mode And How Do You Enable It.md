### **45. What is offline mode, and how do you enable it?**

*   **What it is:** **Offline mode** allows a canvas app to function without an active internet connection. Users can view, add, and edit data locally, which is then synchronized with the server when a connection is restored.
*   **How to Enable (for Dataverse):**
    1.  **Prerequisite:** Your app's primary data source must be **Microsoft Dataverse**.
    2.  **Enable Feature:** In Power Apps Studio, go to **Settings > Upcoming features > Preview** and turn on **"Offline"**.
    3.  **Configure Offline Data:** Go to **Settings > Offline**. Here, you must explicitly add the **Tables (Entities)** you want available offline.
    4.  **Set Sync Interval:** You can configure how often the app syncs data when online.
*   **How it Works:** When the app is launched online, it downloads a local copy of the specified tables. The user then works with this local cache. Any `Patch()`, `Collect()`, or `SubmitForm()` operations are queued. When the app comes back online, it automatically syncs the local changes back to the Dataverse server.
