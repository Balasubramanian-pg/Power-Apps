### **42. What is the difference between Collect() and ClearCollect()?**

*   **`Collect()` Function:**
    *   **Purpose:** **Adds new records** to an existing collection or data source. If the collection doesn't exist, it will be created.
    *   **Behavior:** It **appends** data. Repeated calls will keep adding more records, potentially creating duplicates.
    *   **Syntax:** `Collect( CollectionName, Item, ... )`
    *   **Use Case:** Continuously adding items to a list, like a shopping cart where a user can add multiple quantities of the same product.

*   **`ClearCollect()` Function:**
    *   **Purpose:** A combination of **`Clear`** and **`Collect`**. It first **deletes all existing records** from the collection, then adds the new records.
    *   **Behavior:** It **replaces** the data. Each call results in a fresh collection containing only the newly specified records.
    *   **Syntax:** `ClearCollect( CollectionName, Item, ... )`
    *   **Use Case:** Refreshing a collection with the latest data from a source, such as loading a filtered set of records when a screen loads. This is the most common method for initializing a collection.
