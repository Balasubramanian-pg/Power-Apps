### **48. What is CDS (Common Data Service), and how do you use it?**

*   **What it is:** **Common Data Service (CDS)** is now known as **Microsoft Dataverse**. It is the premium, cloud-based data storage platform that is the backbone of the Power Platform.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Structured, Relational Data:** Stores data in a structured format of **Tables** (entities) and **Columns** (attributes).
    *   **Rich Metadata:** Supports complex data types, relationships, and business logic.
    *   **Built-in Security:** Provides robust, role-based security at the table and row level.
    *   **Business Logic:** Allows for the creation of **Business Rules**, **Workflows**, and **Calculated Columns** directly within the data layer.
*   **How to Use It:**
    1.  **Create Tables:** In [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), go to **"Dataverse" > "Tables"** and create your custom tables (e.g., "Project", "Client").
    2.  **Add Columns:** Define the columns for each table (e.g., "Project Name" (Text), "Start Date" (Date), "Client" (Lookup)).
    3.  **Connect Your App:** In Power Apps Studio, add a new data source and select **"Dataverse"**. Choose the tables you created.
    4.  **Build Your App:** Use the Dataverse tables in forms, galleries, and formulas just like any other data source, but with the added benefit of built-in relationships and logic.
