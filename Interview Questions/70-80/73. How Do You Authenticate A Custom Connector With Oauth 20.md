### **73. How do you authenticate a custom connector with OAuth 2.0?**

*   **Concept:** **OAuth 2.0** is a secure authorization protocol that allows the custom connector to act on behalf of a user without handling their password directly.
*   **Configuration Steps:**
    1.  **In the Custom Connector:** Under the **"Security"** section, select **OAuth 2.0** as the authentication type.
    2.  **Provide Identity Provider Details:**
        *   **Identity Provider:** Often **"Azure Active Directory"**, "Generic OAuth 2", etc.
        *   **Client ID:** The Application (client) ID from your Azure AD App Registration.
        *   **Client Secret:** A secret key generated in the Azure AD App Registration.
        *   **Authorization URL:** The endpoint where users are directed to log in (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`).
        *   **Token URL:** The endpoint used to exchange an authorization code for an access token (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token`).
        *   **Scope:** The permissions being requested (e.g., `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`).
        *   **Redirect URL:** The callback URL, which Power Apps provides for you to copy back into your Azure AD App Registration.
    3.  **Configure Azure AD (or other provider):** You must create an **App Registration** in your Azure AD tenant and configure it with the Power Apps redirect URI and the necessary API permissions.
