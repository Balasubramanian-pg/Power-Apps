### **79. How do you deploy a custom PCF control?**

*   **Prerequisite:** The **Power Platform CLI** must be installed.
*   **Deployment Process:**
    1.  **Create the Component:** Use the CLI command `pac pcf init` to scaffold a new project.
    2.  **Develop and Build:** Write your TypeScript/HTML/CSS code. Use `npm run build` to create the production bundle.
    3.  **Create a Solution Project:** In a separate directory, use `pac solution init` to create a new solution project.
    4.  **Add the Component to the Solution:** Use `pac solution add-reference` to link your PCF code project to the solution project.
    5.  **Build the Solution:** Use `pac solution build` to package everything into a `.zip` file.
    6.  **Import into Environment:**
        *   Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) -> **Solutions**.
        *   Click **"Import solution"** and upload the `.zip` file.
    7.  **Publish:** Once imported, you may need to click **"Publish all customizations"** for the component to become available.
