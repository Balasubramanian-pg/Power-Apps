### **72. What is OpenAPI (Swagger), and how do you use it in Power Apps?**

*   **What it is:** **OpenAPI** (formerly Swagger) is a standard, language-agnostic specification for describing RESTful APIs. It defines all the available endpoints, operations, parameters, authentication methods, and return values in a single YAML or JSON file.
*   **How to Use it in Power Apps:**
    *   The most efficient way to create a custom connector is to **import an OpenAPI definition file**.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Obtain the `openapi.json` or `swagger.json` file from the API provider or generate it if you control the API.
        2.  When creating a new custom connector, choose **"Import an OpenAPI file"**.
        3.  Upload the JSON/YAML file.
        4.  Power Apps will automatically populate the **General**, **Security**, and **Definition** sections based on the OpenAPI spec.
    *   **Benefit:** This method is far faster and less error-prone than manually defining every action and parameter, as it automatically creates the connector's structure from the authoritative source.
