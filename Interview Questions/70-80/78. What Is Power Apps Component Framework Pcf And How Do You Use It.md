### **78. What is Power Apps Component Framework (PCF), and how do you use it?**

*   **What it is:** The **Power Apps Component Framework (PCF)** is a development framework for creating **custom code components** for both canvas and model-driven apps. These components can do things that native controls cannot.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Code-Based:** Built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript.
    *   **Reusable:** Can be used across multiple apps and solutions.
    *   **Enhanced Functionality:** Examples include a multi-select dropdown, a map control with custom pins, a Kanban board, or a complex charting component.
*   **How to Use It:**
    1.  **Development:** Developers use the **Power Platform CLI** to create a new PCF project, write the code, and build the component bundle.
    2.  **Import:** The compiled component is packaged into a solution file (`.zip`).
    3.  **Deploy:** The solution is imported into your Power Apps environment via the Admin Center.
    4.  **Use in Apps:**
        *   **Model-Driven:** Add the component to a form or view.
        *   **Canvas:** Go to **Insert -> Custom -> Import components**, and then you can add the component to your screen like any other control.
