### **76. How do you call Azure Cognitive Services from Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** **Azure Cognitive Services** provides AI capabilities like vision, language, and speech. You call these APIs from Power Apps to add intelligent features.
*   **Primary Method: Create a Custom Connector.**
    1.  **Get API Details:** In the Azure portal, find your Cognitive Service resource (e.g., Computer Vision, Text Analytics). Note the **Endpoint** and **Key**.
    2.  **Create Custom Connector:**
        *   Use the Cognitive Service's **OpenAPI (Swagger) definition** if available for import.
        *   Or, create it manually. Set the **Host** to your endpoint and use **API Key** authentication (usually in the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header).
    3.  **Define an Action:** For example, for the Computer Vision "Describe Image" API, you would create a POST action to the `/vision/v3.2/describe` endpoint, with the image binary or URL in the request body.
    4.  **Use in Power Apps:** Add the custom connector to your app. You can now pass an image from an **Add Picture control** or a URL to the connector's action and display the AI-generated description.
