### **77. How do you use Webhooks in Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** A **webhook** is a mechanism for an external service to send real-time notifications to your app. Power Apps itself cannot *host* a webhook endpoint, but it can *consume* them via Power Automate/Logic Apps.
*   **Implementation Pattern:**
    1.  **Create a Power Automate Flow:** This flow will act as the webhook receiver.
    2.  **Use the "When a HTTP request is received" Trigger:** This trigger provides a unique URL—this is your **webhook URL**. You provide this URL to the external service (e.g., GitHub, a custom app).
    3.  **Process the Incoming Data:** When the external service sends a POST request to that URL (the "webhook fire"), the flow triggers.
    4.  **Notify Power Apps:** The flow must then push this notification to Power Apps. This can be done in two ways:
        *   **Using the "Power Apps" Connector:** The flow can use the **"Post to Power Apps"** action to send data directly to your running app (requires a premium connector).
        *   **Writing to a Data Source:** The flow can `Patch` the received data into a Dataverse or SharePoint list. Your Power App can then poll this list or use a Timer control to check for new entries.
