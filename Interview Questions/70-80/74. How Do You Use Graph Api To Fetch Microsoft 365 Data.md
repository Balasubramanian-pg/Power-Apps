### **74. How do you use Graph API to fetch Microsoft 365 data?**

*   **Concept:** **Microsoft Graph API** is a unified API endpoint for accessing data across Microsoft 365 services. You can use it to interact with users, emails, calendars, files, and more.
*   **Implementation Methods:**
    *   **Method 1: Use the Built-in "Microsoft Graph" Connector:**
        *   This is the simplest method for common scenarios.
        *   Add it as a data source in Power Apps.
        *   When you connect, you must specify the **permission scopes** your app needs (e.g., `User.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite.All`).
        *   You can then use pre-defined actions or call HTTP requests directly.
    *   **Method 2: Create a Custom Connector for Specific Graph Endpoints:**
        *   Useful if you need to call less common Graph endpoints or want more control.
        *   Create a custom connector with the **Host** as `graph.microsoft.com` and **Base URL** as `/v1.0`.
        *   Use OAuth 2.0 authentication with Azure AD.
        *   Define custom actions for the specific Graph API calls you need (e.g., `GET /me/events`).
    *   **Example Call (Using built-in connector):** `Office365Users.MyProfile().DisplayName` or `MicrosoftGraph.GetMyProfile().displayName`.
