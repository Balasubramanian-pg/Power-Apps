### **75. What is Azure Logic Apps, and how do you integrate it?**

*   **What it is:** **Azure Logic Apps** is a cloud-based service for creating and running automated workflows that integrate apps, data, services, and systems. It's a more powerful, serverless cousin of Power Automate.
*   **How to Integrate with Power Apps:**
    *   The integration pattern is identical to Power Automate.
    1.  **Create a Logic App:** In the Azure portal, create a new Logic App.
    2.  **Use the "When a HTTP request is received" Trigger:** This is the equivalent of the "Power Apps" trigger. It provides a unique URL for Power Apps to call.
    3.  **Build the Workflow:** Add any number of complex actions—from data transformations and conditionals to calls to other Azure services or on-premises systems via the data gateway.
    4.  **Add a "Response" Action:** At the end of your workflow, add a Response action to send data back to the Power App that called it.
    5.  **Call from Power Apps:** Use the **"Power Apps"** connector (not the "HTTP" action) or a **custom connector** pointing to the Logic App's HTTP trigger URL to invoke the workflow from your app.
