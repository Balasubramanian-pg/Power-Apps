### **80. How do you use Power FX for advanced formulas?**

*   **Concept:** **Power Fx** is the low-code formula language used across the Power Platform. "Advanced" use involves combining functions and patterns to solve complex problems.
*   **Advanced Patterns and Techniques:**
    *   **Complex Data Shaping with `AddColumns` & `DropColumns`:** Create new, calculated tables on the fly.
        *   **Example:** `AddColumns( Products, "TotalValue", 'UnitsInStock' * 'UnitPrice' )`
    *   **Advanced `Filter` Logic:** Use `And`/`Or` operators and nested conditions.
        *   **Example:** `Filter( Orders, Status = "Shipped" && ( ShipCountry = "USA" || ShipCountry = "Canada" ) && ShippedDate > DateAdd( Today(), -30 ) )`
    *   **Variable Scoping and Management:** Use context and global variables to manage complex app state, passing values between screens and components.
    *   **Error Handling with `IfError`:** Wrap entire sequences of operations to provide graceful fallbacks.
    *   **Working with Untyped Objects:** Use the **`ShowColumns`**, **`ForAll`**, and **`AsType`** functions to work with complex, dynamic JSON data returned from APIs.
    *   **Dynamic Control Properties:** Use formulas to set properties like `X`, `Y`, `Visible`, and `Items` based on complex conditions and calculations, enabling highly dynamic and responsive UIs.
