The "layers" of a listed gallery in Power Apps refer to the controls and the structural components that make up each individual item displayed in the gallery. These controls are placed inside the **template** of the gallery.

A Power Apps **Gallery** control functions as a container that displays a list of records from a data source. The structure for a single record, known as the **item template**, is defined once and then repeated for every item in the data set.

The layers within a gallery item template typically include:

* **Gallery Template (The Outer Layer):** This is the bounding box for a single item (record) in the gallery. Any changes made to the size, properties, or controls within this template are automatically applied to all other items in the list. Key properties like **`TemplateSize`** (height or width depending on orientation) define this layer.
    * *Conceptually, this is the canvas for one data record.*

* **Controls (The Inner Layers):** These are the individual user interface elements placed inside the template to display the data for that record. They form the visible layers and can be stacked in any order. Common controls include:
    * **Labels** (to display text fields like titles, names, dates, etc.)
    * **Images** (to display picture fields)
    * **Buttons** or **Icons** (for user actions related to the specific item, like selecting, editing, or expanding details)
    * **Rectangles** or other shapes (used for visual dividers, highlighting the selected item, or as backgrounds)
    * **Text Inputs** or other input controls (to allow editing of the data)

    Each control's property is usually bound to the current item's data using the **`ThisItem`** operator (e.g., `ThisItem.ProductName`).

* **Nested Galleries (A Complex Inner Layer):** While generally discouraged for performance reasons, a gallery can contain another gallery within its item template. This creates a **nested gallery** structure, which forms a hierarchical, second layer of listed data related to the parent item.
    * *Example: A parent gallery lists projects, and a nested (child) gallery inside each project item lists the tasks for that specific project.*
