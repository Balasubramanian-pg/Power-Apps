Row-level security in Dataverse isn’t a direct “RLS” feature like in SQL or Power BI. It’s more about **security roles + business units + ownership**. The layers work like this:

1. **Table ownership**

   * Tables can be **User/Team-owned** or **Organization-owned**.
   * Only User/Team-owned tables can have row-level control.

2. **Security roles**

   * In a role, you set privileges (Read, Write, Append, etc.) at scopes:

     * **User** → only their own records.
     * **Business Unit** → their BU’s records.
     * **Parent: Child BU** → BU and its children.
     * **Organization** → everything.

3. **Teams and access teams**

   * Add users to teams with specific roles for finer-grained row-level access.

4. **Sharing**

   * Specific records can be shared with individuals/teams with custom permissions.

So, RLS in Dataverse = design ownership model + assign security roles with the right scope + optionally layer in sharing/teams.
