### **83. What is a business rule, and how do you implement it?**

*   **What it is:** A **business rule** provides a no-code way to apply custom logic and validation to a Dataverse table's forms. It allows you to automate processes without writing code.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Set field values** (e.g., automatically calculate a total).
    *   **Show or hide fields.**
    *   **Set field requirement levels** (e.g., make a field required only if another field has a specific value).
    *   **Validate data** and show error messages.
    *   **Enable or disable fields.**
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Navigate to Business Rules:** Open your table in the Power Apps portal, go to the **"Business rules"** tab.
    2.  **Create New Rule:** Click **"New business rule"**.
    3.  **Design the Logic:** Use the visual designer to drag and configure components:
        *   **Condition:** The "IF" part of your rule (e.g., "If Status equals 'Active'").
        *   **Action:** The "THEN" part (e.g., "Then show the 'Reason' field," "Then set the 'Expiry Date' field to 30 days from today").
    4.  **Scope and Activate:**
        *   Set the scope to **"All Forms"** or a specific form.
        *   **Activate** the business rule. It will now run automatically whenever a form is loaded or data is changed, based on your conditions.
