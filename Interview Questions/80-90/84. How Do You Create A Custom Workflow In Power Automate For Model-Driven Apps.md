### **84. How do you create a custom workflow in Power Automate for model-driven apps?**

*   **Concept:** While "classic workflows" exist in Dataverse, the modern, powerful way to create server-side automation is using **Power Automate cloud flows** triggered from model-driven apps.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Create a Cloud Flow:** In Power Automate, create a new flow.
    2.  **Choose the Trigger:** Use the **"When a row is added, modified, or deleted"** trigger from the Dataverse connector. This is the most common trigger for background automation.
        *   Specify the **Table name** (e.g., "Projects").
        *   Specify the **Scope** (e.g., "Organization" to run on any record, or "User" to run only on records the triggering user owns).
    3.  **Add Actions:** Build your workflow logic. This can include:
        *   **Creating/Updating** other rows in Dataverse.
        *   **Sending emails** or **Teams notifications**.
        *   **Calling external APIs** via the HTTP action.
        *   **Running an Office Script** on an Excel file.
    4.  **Test and Activate:** Test the flow with sample data and turn it on. It will now run automatically in the background based on the Dataverse trigger you configured.
