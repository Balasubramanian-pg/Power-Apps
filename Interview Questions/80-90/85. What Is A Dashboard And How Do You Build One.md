### **85. What is a dashboard, and how do you build one?**

*   **What it is:** A **dashboard** in a model-driven app is a single screen that displays multiple visualizations (charts and lists) from various tables, providing an at-a-glance view of key business metrics.
*   **Types of Dashboards:**
    *   **Interactive Dashboards:** Allow users to filter and drill down into the data.
    *   **Classic Dashboards:** A fixed view of data.
*   **How to Build One:**
    1.  **Navigate to Dashboards:** In [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), go to **"Dataverse" > "Dashboards"**.
    2.  **Create New Dashboard:** Click **"New dashboard"** and choose a layout (e.g., 2-column, 3-column).
    3.  **Add Components:** In the designer, click **"Add Component"** for each cell in the layout. You can add:
        *   **Chart:** Select an existing system chart or a custom one you've created for a table.
        *   **List:** Embeds a view from a table, showing a list of relevant records.
        *   **iFrame:** Embeds a web resource or external website.
        *   **Web Resource:** Embeds a custom HTML/JavaScript file.
    4.  **Configure Components:** For each chart or list, you select the source table and the specific chart or view.
    5.  **Assign to App:** Once saved, the dashboard will be available to add to your model-driven app's sitemap.
