### **82. How do you create a custom entity in Dataverse?**

*   **What it is:** A **custom entity** (now commonly referred to as a **custom table**) is a container you create to store a specific type of data that isn't covered by the standard tables (like Account or Contact).
*   **Creation Process:**
    1.  **Navigate to Tables:** In [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), go to **"Dataverse" > "Tables"**.
    2.  **Create New Table:** Click **"+ New table"**.
    3.  **Define Table Properties:**
        *   **Display name:** The user-friendly name (e.g., "Project").
        *   **Plural name:** The plural display name (e.g., "Projects").
        *   **Primary Name Column:** The default column used to identify a record (e.g., "Project Name"). This is like the "Title" column in SharePoint.
    4.  **Configure Ownership (Crucial for Security):**
        *   **User:** Records are owned by individual users. Enables row-level security where users can only see their own records.
        *   **Organization:** Records are owned by the organization and are visible to all users with appropriate privileges.
    5.  **Click "Create":** The table is created with the primary name column and system columns (like `Created On`). You can then add custom columns to it.
