### **87. What is Duet AI, and how do you use it in model-driven apps?**

*   **What it is:** **Duet AI** (now often referred to in the context of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365) is an AI assistant that integrates across the Microsoft Cloud, including the Power Platform. In model-driven apps, it can help users interact with data using natural language.
*   **How to Use It (Example Scenarios):**
    *   **Natural Language Search & Filtering:** Instead of building complex advanced find views, users can type queries like **"Show me all opportunities in the Western region with a value over $50,000 that are closing this month"** directly into a search bar powered by AI.
    *   **Summarizing Record Data:** While viewing a long case or opportunity record, an AI copilot could summarize the key details, recent activities, and next steps.
    *   **Generating Content:** Assist sales reps by drafting email content to a client based on the data within an opportunity record.
*   **Implementation:** This functionality is typically enabled at the platform level by administrators. App makers then expose these AI capabilities within their apps by adding the relevant Copilot controls or enabling the features in views and forms.
