### **90. How do you implement auditing in Dataverse?**

*   **What it is:** **Dataverse Auditing** is a feature that automatically tracks changes made to records, including what was changed, who changed it, and when. This is crucial for compliance and troubleshooting.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Enable Auditing at the Environment Level:** An administrator must go to the **Power Platform Admin Center** -> **Your Environment** -> **"Settings"** -> **"Audit and logs"** -> **"Audit settings"** and turn on **"Start Auditing"**.
    2.  **Enable Auditing for Specific Tables:** For each table you want to audit, open the table in the maker portal. Go to its **"Settings"** and ensure **"Auditing"** is enabled under the "Data" section.
    3.  **Enable Auditing for Specific Columns (Optional):** For each table, you can drill down and select which specific columns should be audited. This is important for performance and relevance, as auditing every field can generate significant data.
*   **Viewing Audit Data:**
    *   **Via the UI:** In a model-driven app, you can view the audit history for a specific record by going to the **"Related"** menu and selecting **"Audit History"**.
    *   **Via Advanced Find:** You can create an Advanced Find query on the "Audit" table to generate custom audit reports.
    *   **Via Power BI:** You can connect Power BI to the Dataverse audit table to create comprehensive compliance dashboards.
