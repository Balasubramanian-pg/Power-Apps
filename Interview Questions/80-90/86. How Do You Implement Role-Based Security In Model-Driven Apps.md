### **86. How do you implement role-based security in model-driven apps?**

*   **Concept:** **Role-based security** in model-driven apps is enforced by the underlying **Dataverse**. The app itself merely reflects the data permissions defined by the user's security roles.
*   **Implementation Process:**
    1.  **Define Security Roles:** In the Power Platform Admin Center, go to your environment and navigate to **"Settings" > "Security" > "Security Roles"**.
    2.  **Create or Modify a Role:** Create a new role (e.g., "Regional Sales Manager") or edit an existing one.
    3.  **Set Table-Level Permissions:** For each relevant table (e.g., Account, Opportunity, your custom "Project" table), set the **CRUD** permissions:
        *   **Create, Read, Write, Delete, Append, Append To, Assign, Share.**
        *   The critical permission is **"Read"**, which can be set at different levels:
            *   **Organization:** See all records.
            *   **Parent: Child Business Units:** See records in your BU and subordinate BUs.
            *   **Business Unit:** See records only in your BU.
            *   **User:** See only records you own.
    4.  **Assign Roles to Users/Groups:** Assign the security roles to individual users or, more efficiently, to **Azure Active Directory Groups**. Users inherit the permissions of all roles assigned to them.
