### **81. What is a site map, and how do you customize it?**

*   **What it is:** The **site map** is the navigation menu (the left-hand pane) in a model-driven app. It defines the structure and grouping of all the areas, sub-areas, and components that users can access.
*   **How to Customize It:**
    1.  **Access the Sitemap Designer:** In the model-driven app designer, select the **"Navigation"** component in the tree view on the left.
    2.  **Understand the Hierarchy:** The sitemap is structured as:
        *   **Area:** The top-level navigation group (e.g., "Sales," "Service," "Marketing"). These appear as the main tabs at the top level of the left pane.
        *   **Sub-area:** Groups within an Area (e.g., "Accounts," "Contacts" within the "Sales" area). These appear as expandable sections.
        *   **Group:** A visual container inside a Sub-area to further organize links.
        *   **URL/Entity/Dashboard/Page:** The actual links that users click on. These can point to a table (entity) view, a dashboard, a custom page, or an external URL.
    3.  **Drag-and-Drop Editing:** You can add, remove, and reorder these elements using a visual designer. To add a new table, you simply drag the "Entity" component from the toolbox into the desired Sub-area.
    4.  **Publish Changes:** After customizing, you must **"Save"** and **"Publish"** the sitemap for the changes to become visible to users.
