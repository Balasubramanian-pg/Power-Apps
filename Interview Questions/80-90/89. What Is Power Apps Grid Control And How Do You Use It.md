### **89. What is Power Apps Grid Control, and how do you use it?**

*   **What it is:** The **Power Apps Grid Control** (also known as the Editable Grid) is a modern control that can be added to a main form or as a subgrid. It allows users to **view and edit multiple records in a spreadsheet-like experience** without opening each record individually.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Inline Editing:** Click a cell and edit the value directly.
    *   **Bulk Editing:** Change a value for multiple selected rows at once.
    *   **Sorting and Filtering:** Users can easily sort columns and apply filters.
    *   **Excel-like Experience:** Provides a familiar interface for data manipulation.
*   **How to Use It:**
    1.  **On a Main Form:** In the form designer, you can add the grid control to display related rows. For example, on a Project form, you could add a grid of related "Project Tasks" and edit them inline.
    2.  **As a Subgrid:** You can add the grid control to a form in a subgrid section to show related records from another table. This is the most common use case, allowing users to manage child records (like tasks or contacts) directly from the parent record's form.
