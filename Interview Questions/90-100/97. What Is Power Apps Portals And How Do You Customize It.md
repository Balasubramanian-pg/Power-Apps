*   **What it is:** **Power Apps Portals** (now part of **Power Pages**) is a service for creating external-facing websites that allow users outside your organization to interact with data in Dataverse, either anonymously or through authentication.
*   **Customization Areas:**
    1.  **Portals Studio:** The low-code WYSIWYG editor for adding and configuring web pages, forms, lists, and static content.
    2.  **Liquid Templates:** A server-side templating language for advanced customization. You can use Liquid to dynamically display Dataverse data, implement complex logic, and loop through records.

    4.  **Table Permissions and Web Roles:** The core of Portals security. You configure **Web Roles** and then define precisely what data each role can **Create, Read, Update, or Delete (CRUD)** on a per-table basis.
