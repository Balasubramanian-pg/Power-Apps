### **100. What are best practices for enterprise-scale Power Apps deployment?**

*   **Environment Strategy:**
    *   Use a **hub-and-spoke** model: Separate **Development, Test, and Production** environments.
    *   Consider a "Gold" environment for master solution development.
*   **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM):**
    *   Use **Solutions** to package and move all app components (apps, flows, custom connectors, tables) between environments.
    *   Use **Azure DevOps** or GitHub with the **Power Platform CLI** for source control, automated builds, and deployment pipelines (CI/CD).
*   **Data Management:**
    *   Standardize on **Dataverse** as the primary data platform for its security, relational integrity, and performance.
    *   Implement **data loss prevention (DLP) policies** to control which connectors can be used together, protecting corporate data.
*   **Governance and Security:**
    *   Define a **Center of Excellence (CoE)** to set standards, provide training, and manage the platform.
    *   Implement **role-based security** in Dataverse meticulously.
    *   Use **AAD Groups** to manage user access to apps and environments.
*   **Performance and Monitoring:**
    *   Use the **Center of Excellence Starter Kit** to gain insights into app usage, performance, and compliance.
    *   Establish performance benchmarks and monitor for apps with poor performance or high error rates.
