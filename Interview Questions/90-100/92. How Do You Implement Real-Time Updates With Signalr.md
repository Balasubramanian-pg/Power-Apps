### **92. How do you implement real-time updates with SignalR?**

*   **Concept:** **Azure SignalR Service** enables real-time communication, allowing a service to push updates to connected clients (like your Power App) instantly, without the app having to constantly poll the server.
*   **Implementation Pattern (Using Power Automate as a Bridge):**
    1.  **Set Up SignalR Service:** Create an **Azure SignalR Service** resource in your Azure subscription.
    2.  **Create a "Negotiate" Flow:** Create a Power Automate flow with an HTTP trigger that returns the SignalR connection info. Power Apps will call this to establish a connection.
    3.  **Create a "Broadcast" Flow:** Create another flow that your backend system can call. This flow uses the **Azure SignalR** connector to send a message to all connected clients.
    4.  **Integrate with Power Apps:**
        *   Use a **Power Apps custom connector** to call your "Negotiate" flow and establish the real-time connection.
        *   Use the **`SignalR.OnMessage`** property (in an HTML text control or via a component) to define the action to take when a new message is received (e.g., `Refresh( YourDataSource )` or `Set( varNewAlert, true )`).
*   **Use Case:** A dashboard that automatically updates when another user changes a record, or a live notification system within an app.
