### **98. How do you implement single sign-on (SSO) in Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** **Single Sign-On (SSO)** allows users to access Power Apps without being prompted for credentials again if they are already signed into their Microsoft 365 account.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   SSO is **enabled by default** for Power Apps within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. When a user accesses an app from [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), the Teams app, or a SharePoint site, they are automatically authenticated using their existing Microsoft 365 session.
*   **For External Authentication (Power Apps Portals):**
    *   SSO is configured by setting up **external identity providers**.
    *   In the Power Pages admin center, you can configure providers like **Azure AD B2C, Microsoft, Google, or Facebook**.
    *   Users can then sign in to the portal using their credentials from these providers, providing a seamless SSO experience if they are already logged in there.
