### **99. How do you use Power BI embedded in Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** You can embed interactive **Power BI reports** directly into a canvas app, creating a rich, data-driven experience.
*   **Implementation Methods:**
    1.  **Power BI Tile Control (Simpler):**
        *   Insert the **"Power BI"** control from the "Insert -> Media" menu.
        *   In the properties, you must connect to your Power BI workspace and select a specific **Dashboard** and **Tile**.
        *   This method is limited to displaying individual tiles from a dashboard.
    2.  **Power BI Report Visual Control (More Powerful):**
        *   This is the recommended method for full reports.
        *   Go to **"Insert -> Custom -> Get more components"**.
        *   From the "Power BI" tab, add the **"Power BI Report Visual"** custom component (this is a PCF control).
        *   Configure it by specifying your **Workspace**, **Report**, and optionally a **Page** from the report.
        *   You can even **pass filter context** from your app to the report, making the report interactive based on app data (e.g., filter the report to show data for the account selected in your gallery).
