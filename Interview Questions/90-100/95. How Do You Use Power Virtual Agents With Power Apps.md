### **95. How do you use Power Virtual Agents with Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** **Power Virtual Agents (PVA)** allows you to create powerful chatbots without coding. You can embed these chatbots into your Power Apps to provide guided assistance or automate tasks.
*   **Integration Methods:**
    1.  **Embed the Chatbot in a Canvas App:**
        *   In your PVA chatbot, go to the **"Channels"** section and enable the **"Custom website"** channel. Copy the provided HTML code snippet.
        *   In your Power App, add an **HTML Text** control.
        *   Paste the HTML snippet into the `HtmlText` property of the control. The chatbot will now appear as an embedded widget in your app.
    2.  **Call a Power App from the Bot (Power Automate Integration):**
        *   In your PVA topic, add a **"Call an action"** node.
        *   This action calls a **Power Automate flow**.
        *   The flow can, in turn, use the **"Power Apps" connector** to trigger an action or pass data *into* your running Power App, such as opening a specific screen or populating a form.
