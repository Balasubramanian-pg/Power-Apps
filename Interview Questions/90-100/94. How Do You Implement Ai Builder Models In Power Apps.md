### **94. How do you implement AI Builder models in Power Apps?**

*   **Concept:** **AI Builder** allows you to add AI capabilities to your apps without writing code. You can use pre-built models or train custom models to understand your business documents, images, or text.
*   **Implementation Process:**
    1.  **Create or Choose a Model:** In the Power Platform, go to **AI Builder > Models**. You can train a **custom model** (e.g., to extract information from your specific invoices) or use a **pre-built model** (e.g., "Business Card Reader," "Object Detection").
    2.  **Train and Publish:** For a custom model, you provide sample documents, label the data you want to extract, train the model, and then **publish** it.
    3.  **Use in a Canvas App:**
        *   Add the AI Builder model as a data source in your Power App.
        *   Use the controls provided by the model. For example, the **"Form Processor"** model adds a camera control and a "Process" button.
        *   The button's `OnSelect` property will call the model: `'FormProcessor'.ProcessForm()`
        *   The extracted data (e.g., `FormProcessor.Fields.InvoiceNumber`) is now available in variables and can be patched to a data source.
