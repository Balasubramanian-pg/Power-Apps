### **12. What is a collection, and how do you create one using ClearCollect()?**

*   **What it is:** A **collection** is a temporary, in-memory table of data that is stored locally on the user's device. It is extremely versatile and used for storing data you don't want to query repeatedly, manipulating data, holding user selections, or working offline.
*   **How to Create with `ClearCollect()`:**
    *   The **`ClearCollect`** function is the most common way to create and populate a collection. It performs two actions:
        1.  **`Clear`**: Deletes all the records from a collection if it already exists.
        2.  **`Collect`**: Creates the collection (if it doesn't exist) and adds the specified records to it.
    *   **Syntax:** `ClearCollect( CollectionName, DataSource )`
    *   **Example:** `ClearCollect( colEmployees, SharePointEmployeesList )`
        *   This clears `colEmployees` (or creates it) and then populates it with all the data from the `SharePointEmployeesList`.
    *   You can use this function in the **`OnStart`** property of the app or the **`OnSelect`** property of a button.
