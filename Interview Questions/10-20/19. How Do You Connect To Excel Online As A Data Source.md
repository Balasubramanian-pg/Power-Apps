### **19. How do you connect to Excel Online as a data source?**

*   **Prerequisite:** The Excel file must be stored in **OneDrive for Business** or a **SharePoint Document Library**, and the data must be in a ** formatted Excel Table** (not just a range of cells).
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Step 1:** In the **Data sources** panel, click **"Add data source"**.
    *   **Step 2:** Select the **"OneDrive for Business"** or **"SharePoint"** connector (depending on where your file is stored).
    *   **Step 3:** Navigate to and select your **Excel file**.
    *   **Step 4:** After selecting the file, Power Apps will show a list of the **Tables** within that workbook. Select the table you want to use.
    *   **Step 5:** Click **"Connect"**. The Excel table now appears as a data source, and you can use it just like a SharePoint list.
