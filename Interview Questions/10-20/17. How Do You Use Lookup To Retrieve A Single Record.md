### **17. How do you use LookUp() to retrieve a single record?**

*   **Purpose:** The **`LookUp()`** function searches a data source and returns the **first record** that matches a specified condition.
*   **Syntax:** `LookUp( DataSource, LogicalTest, [ResultIfFound] )`
*   **Common Use Cases:**
    *   **Populating a Detail Screen:** When a user clicks an item in a gallery, `LookUp` fetches the full record to display on a new screen.
        *   **Example:** `LookUp( SharePointEmployeesList, ID = Gallery1.Selected.ID )`
    *   **Getting a Specific Field:** You can also return just a single column from the found record.
        *   **Example:** `LookUp( SharePointEmployeesList, ID = 5, "Email Address" )` would return just the email string for the employee with ID 5.
    *   **Use with Variables:** `Set( varCurrentEmployee, LookUp( SharePointEmployeesList, ID = Gallery1.Selected.ID ) )`
