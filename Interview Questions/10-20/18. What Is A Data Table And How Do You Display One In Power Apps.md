### **18. What is a data table, and how do you display one in Power Apps?**

*   **What it is:** The **Data table** control is a structured, tabular control designed specifically for displaying a table of data. Unlike a Gallery, it presents data in a traditional row-and-column format, similar to an Excel table.
*   **How to Display One:**
    *   **Step 1:** Insert a Data table control from the **"Insert"** menu under **"Display"**.
    *   **Step 2:** Set its **`Data source`** property to your data source (e.g., `SharePointEmployeesList`).
    *   **Step 3 (Configure Fields):**
        *   Select the data table.
        *   In the right-hand properties pane, click **"Edit fields"**.
        *   Click **"Add field"** and select the columns from your data source you want to display.
    *   You can reorder columns by dragging the field headers and change their display name by double-clicking the header in the data table.
