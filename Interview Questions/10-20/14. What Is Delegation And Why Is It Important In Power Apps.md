### **14. What is delegation, and why is it important in Power Apps?**

*   **What it is:** **Delegation** is the process where the data processing workload is **"delegated" to the data source** (e.g., SharePoint, SQL Server) instead of being pulled into the app and processed locally on your device.
*   **Why it is Critically Important:**
    *   **Performance:** Data sources are powerful servers designed to handle large datasets. Sending a filtered query to the server is vastly faster than downloading 100,000 records to your phone and then filtering them locally.
    *   **Data Limits:** Many data sources have a **delegation limit** (often 500, 2000, or 2000 records). If a function cannot be delegated, Power Apps will only retrieve the *first* set of records up to that limit, and then filter them locally. **This means you could miss data.**
*   **Key Takeaway:** You must use **delegable functions** (like `=`, `<`, `>`, `StartsWith`, `Filter`) with data source columns that support delegation to ensure you work with your complete dataset. Non-delegable functions (like `Search`, `in`, `Contains`) can cause performance issues and data loss with large datasets.
