### **20. What is the Search() function, and how do you implement search in a gallery?**

*   **What it is:** The **`Search()`** function is a simple way to search for text across multiple columns in a data source. **Important Note:** It has significant delegation limitations and should only be used on small datasets (< 500 records).
*   **How to Implement a Search Box:**
    *   **Step 1:** Add a **Text input** control to your screen. This will be your search box. Rename it to `txtSearch`.
    *   **Step 2:** Select your **Gallery** control.
    *   **Step 3:** Set the gallery's **`Items`** property to the `Search()` function.
    *   **Syntax:** `Search( DataSource, SearchString, Column1, Column2, ... )`
    *   **Example:** `Search( SharePointEmployeesList, txtSearch.Text, "Title", "Department", "Email" )`
    *   This will filter the gallery to show only records where the text in `txtSearch.Text` appears in the "Title", "Department", or "Email" columns.
*   **Delegation Warning:** For large datasets, it's better to use the delegable **`Filter()`** function with **`StartsWith()`** on a single column, e.g., `Filter( DataSource, StartsWith( Title, txtSearch.Text ) )`.
