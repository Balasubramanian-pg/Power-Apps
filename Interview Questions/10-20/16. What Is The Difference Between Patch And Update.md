### **16. What is the difference between Patch() and Update()?**

*   **`Patch()` Function:**
    *   **Purpose:** The primary function for **creating, updating, or modifying records** in a data source. It is highly versatile.
    *   **Syntax:** `Patch( DataSource, BaseRecord, Changes )`
        *   **To Update:** `Patch( Employees, LookUp(Employees, ID=1), {Status: "Inactive"} )`
        *   **To Create:** `Patch( Employees, Defaults(Employees), {Title: "Jane Doe", Department: "Sales"} )`
    *   **Use Case:** Use `Patch()` for most data write operations, especially when you need to update specific fields without affecting others.

*   **`Update()` Function:**
    *   **Purpose:** **Only updates an existing record** if it can be found based on all **primary key** columns. It cannot create new records.
    *   **Syntax:** `Update( DataSource, Record, ChangeRecord )` - The `Record` must match the primary key.
    *   **Use Case:** Less common than `Patch()`. It's useful when you have a complete record and want to replace it, but `Patch()` is generally preferred for its flexibility and ability to create records.
