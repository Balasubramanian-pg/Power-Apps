### **13. How do you filter data in a gallery using the Filter() function?**

*   **The Principle:** You don't filter the gallery itself. Instead, you set the gallery's **`Items`** property to a filtered version of your data source.
*   **Using the `Filter()` Function:**
    *   Select your **Gallery** control.
    *   In the property dropdown (just below the ribbon), select **`Items`**.
    *   In the formula bar, you start with a `Filter()` formula that references your data source.
    *   **Syntax:** `Filter( DataSource, LogicalTest )`
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **By a Text Field:** `Filter( SharePointEmployeesList, Department = "Marketing" )`
        *   **By a Choice Field:** `Filter( SharePointEmployeesList, Status.Value = "Active" )`
        *   **By a Number Field:** `Filter( SharePointEmployeesList, 'Vacation Days' > 5 )`
        *   **Using Search:** `Filter( SharePointEmployeesList, StartsWith( Title, TextSearchBox.Text ) )`
*   The gallery will now only display records that meet the filter criteria.
