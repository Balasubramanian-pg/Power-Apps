### **66. What are best practices for reducing app load time?**

*   **Minimize `OnStart` Logic:** Keep the `App.OnStart` property as lean as possible. Avoid loading large datasets or running complex calculations here.
*   **Use Concurrent Loading:** Use the **`Concurrent()`** function to load multiple data sources in parallel within `App.OnStart`.
*   **Delay Non-Critical Data Loads:** Use **lazy loading** for galleries and load data on screen visibility (`OnVisible` property) rather than at app start.
*   **Reduce the Number of Controls:** Screens with hundreds of controls take longer to render. Use galleries to recycle controls for repeating data.
*   **Optimize Images:** Use compressed images and appropriate sizes. Don't use a 4000px wide image if it will only be displayed at 100px.
*   **Limit the Number of Data Sources:** Each connection adds overhead. Reuse data sources across screens instead of creating new connections.
*   **Use Collections Wisely:** Load data into a collection once and reuse it, rather than querying the data source repeatedly.
