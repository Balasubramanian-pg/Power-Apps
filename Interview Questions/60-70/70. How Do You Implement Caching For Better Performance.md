### **70. How do you implement caching for better performance?**

*   **Concept:** **Caching** involves storing data locally to avoid repeated network requests to the data source.
*   **Primary Methods:**
    *   **1. Collections for Read-Only Data:**
        *   For data that doesn't change often (e.g., a list of countries, product categories), load it into a collection in `App.OnStart`.
        *   **Formula:** `If( IsEmpty(colCategories), ClearCollect(colCategories, CategoriesList) )`
        *   The app will use the local `colCategories` for all lookups and filters, which is much faster than querying the data source every time.
    *   **2. `SaveData()` and `LoadData()` for User-Specific Data:**
        *   Cache the user's work or preferences locally on their device.
        *   **OnStart:** `LoadData( colUserSelections, "UserPrefs", false )`
        *   **OnExit/OnHide:** `SaveData( colUserSelections, "UserPrefs" )`
    *   **3. Variables for Session State:**
        *   Use global variables to cache the result of expensive calculations or the currently selected record, so it doesn't need to be recalculated or re-queried on every screen.
