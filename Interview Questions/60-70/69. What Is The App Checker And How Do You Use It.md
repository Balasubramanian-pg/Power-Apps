### **69. What is the App Checker, and how do you use it?**

*   **What it is:** The **App Checker** is a built-in tool that automatically analyzes your app for common performance, accessibility, and usability issues.
*   **How to Use It:**
    1.  In Power Apps Studio, go to the **"File"** menu.
    2.  In the left-hand pane, select **"App checker"**.
    3.  The tool will run automatically and present a list of **Inspection results**.
*   **What It Checks For:**
    *   **Performance:** Unused controls, large images, missing alternative text, and delegation warnings.
    *   **Accessibility:** Missing `TabIndex` orders, missing `Label` controls for inputs, and color contrast issues.
    *   **Usability:** Unsupported functions in the target player (e.g., SharePoint).
*   **Using the Results:** The checker provides a description of each issue, its impact, and a direct link to the problematic control. You can use this information to systematically fix the identified problems and improve your app's quality.
