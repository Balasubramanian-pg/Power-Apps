### **64. What is lazy loading, and how do you implement it?**

*   **What it is:** **Lazy loading** is a design pattern where you delay loading non-essential or off-screen data until the user specifically needs it. This drastically improves initial app load time.
*   **Implementation in a Gallery:**
    1.  **Initial Load:** Set the gallery's `Items` property to load only a small number of records (e.g., `FirstN( YourDataSource, 50 )`).
    2.  **Create a "Load More" Button:**
        *   Add a button at the bottom of the gallery with text "Load More".
        *   Create a global variable to track how many records are loaded (e.g., `Set( _recordsToLoad, 50 )`).
        *   The button's `OnSelect` should increment this variable: `Set( _recordsToLoad, _recordsToLoad + 50 )`.
    3.  **Update Gallery Items:** Modify the gallery's `Items` property to use the variable: `FirstN( YourDataSource, _recordsToLoad )`.
*   **Alternative: Auto-load with Timer:**
    *   Place a **Timer** control at the bottom of the gallery.
    *   Set its `AutoStart` to `true` and `Duration` to a short time (e.g., `100`).
    *   Set its `OnTimerEnd` to the same "Load More" logic and then reset the timer. This creates an infinite scroll effect.
