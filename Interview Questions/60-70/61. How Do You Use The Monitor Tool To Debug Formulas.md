### **61. How do you use the Monitor tool to debug formulas?**

*   **Purpose:** The **Monitor tool** is a real-time logging and diagnostics panel that shows you the sequence and results of every formula execution as you use your app.
*   **How to Access:**
    *   In Power Apps Studio, go to the **"View"** tab on the top ribbon.
    *   Click on **"Monitor"**. This opens the Monitor pane, usually on the right side of the screen.
*   **How to Use It:**
    1.  **Start a Session:** Click **"Start"** in the Monitor tool. It will now record all app activity.
    2.  **Reproduce the Issue:** Interact with your app—click buttons, type in fields, navigate between screens.
    3.  **Analyze the Logs:**
        *   The log shows a **timeline** of events.
        *   Each entry shows the **Control Name**, **Property** (e.g., `OnSelect`), and the **Formula** that was run.
        *   You can **expand any entry** to see a detailed tree view of the formula, including the evaluated result of every function and value within it.
    4.  **Identify Errors:** Errors are highlighted in **red**, making them easy to spot. The detailed view will show you exactly which part of the formula failed.
    5.  **Stop and Clear:** Click **"Stop"** to end the session and **"Clear"** to wipe the log for a new debugging run.
