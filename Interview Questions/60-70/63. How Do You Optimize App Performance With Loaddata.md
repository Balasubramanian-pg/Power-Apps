### **63. How do you optimize app performance with LoadData()?**

*   **Concept:** `LoadData()` is used to load a collection from local storage. Its performance impact is related to **when** and **how much** data you load.
*   **Optimization Strategies:**
    *   **Load on Demand:** Avoid loading large collections in `App.OnStart`. Instead, load data only when a specific screen is accessed or when a user performs an action.
    *   **Load Only Necessary Data:** Use `LoadData()` with **specific keys** to load only the collections needed for the current user context, rather than loading all saved data.
    *   **Use Lazy Loading in Galleries:** Load a small initial dataset, and then use a **Timer** control or a "Load More" button to `LoadData()` for additional records as the user scrolls.
    *   **Profile Data Size:** Be mindful of the amount of data you are saving with `SaveData()`. Large images or thousands of rows will make `LoadData()` slow. Store only essential information.
