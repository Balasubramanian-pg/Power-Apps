### **62. What are delegation warnings, and how do you fix them?**

*   **What They Are:** A **delegation warning** (indicated by a yellow triangle with an exclamation point) appears next to a formula when Power Apps detects that part of it **cannot be translated into a query** for the data source. This means the app will only process the first portion of data (e.g., 500 records) locally, potentially missing information.
*   **How to Fix Them:**
    *   **Use Delegable Functions:** Replace non-delegable functions with their delegable counterparts.
        *   **Example:** Use `Filter(DataSource, StartsWith(Column, "A"))` (delegable) instead of `Search(DataSource, "A", Column)` (non-delegable on many sources).
    *   **Filter on Indexed Columns:** Ensure you are filtering on columns that the data source has indexed for faster querying. Delegation works best on indexed columns.
    *   **Simplify the Query:** Break down complex `Filter` statements or use multiple, simpler galleries/filters.
    *   **Use `ID` Fields for Lookups:** Filtering on a numeric `ID` column is almost always delegable, whereas filtering on a text field might not be.
    *   **Change the Data Source:** If possible, use a data source with higher delegation limits and better support, like **Dataverse** or **SQL Server**, instead of SharePoint lists for large datasets.
