### **68. How do you use variables (Set, UpdateContext) efficiently?**

*   **Understand Scope:**
    *   **Global Variables (`Set()`):** Use for data that needs to be accessed across multiple screens (e.g., a selected record, user information).
    *   **Context Variables (`UpdateContext()`):** Use for data that is only relevant on a single screen (e.g., a toggle state, a screen-specific counter).
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Initialize in `OnStart`/`OnVisible`:** Initialize global variables in `App.OnStart` and context variables in a screen's `OnVisible` property to ensure they have a value before being used.
    *   **Avoid Redundant Sets:** Don't call `Set()` or `UpdateContext()` unnecessarily inside repeating controls (like galleries), as it will execute for every record.
    *   **Use Collections for Complex Data:** For large sets of data that need to be manipulated or searched, use a **Collection** instead of a variable.
    *   **Clear Variables:** Use `Set( varName, Blank() )` to clear global variables when they are no longer needed to free up memory.
