### **21. What is the difference between If() and Switch()?**

*   **`If()` Function:**
    *   **Purpose:** Used to test **one or more sequential conditions** and return different results based on which condition is true.
    *   **Structure:** It follows an `If-Then-Else If-Else` logic.
    *   **Syntax:** `If( Condition, ResultIfTrue, [ResultIfFalse], [Condition2, ResultIfTrue2, ...] )`
    *   **Best For:** Scenarios with **1-3 logical branches** or when conditions are completely different from one another.
    *   **Example:**
        ```powerfx
        If( Rating >= 4.5,
            "Excellent",
            Rating >= 3.5,
            "Good",
            Rating >= 2.5,
            "Average",
            "Poor"
        )
        ```

*   **`Switch()` Function:**
    *   **Purpose:** Used to test a **single expression or value** against a list of possible matches. It's cleaner and more efficient for multiple, discrete comparisons.
    *   **Structure:** It follows a "match this value to one of these cases" logic.
    *   **Syntax:** `Switch( Expression, Match1, Result1, Match2, Result2, ..., [DefaultResult] )`
    *   **Best For:** Scenarios where you are checking the **same field or expression for multiple specific values**.
    *   **Example:**
        ```powerfx
        Switch( Status.Value,
            "New", "🟡 Pending",
            "In Progress", "🔵 Active",
            "Closed", "🟢 Complete",
            "❓ Unknown"
        )
        ```
