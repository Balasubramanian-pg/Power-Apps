### **29. What is the DateDiff() function, and how do you use it?**

*   **Purpose:** The **`DateDiff()`** function calculates the **difference between two dates** in a specified unit (e.g., days, months, years).
*   **Syntax:** `DateDiff( StartDateTime, EndDateTime, Unit )`
*   **Units:** `Years`, `Months`, `Days`, `Hours`, `Minutes`, `Seconds`.
*   **Common Use Cases:**
    *   **Calculating Age:** `DateDiff( ThisItem.BirthDate, Today(), Days ) / 365` (approximate age in years).
    *   **Calculating Days Until Due:** `DateDiff( Today(), ThisItem.DueDate, Days )` - A positive number means it's in the future, a negative number means it's past due.
    *   **Tracking Response Time:** `DateDiff( ThisItem.CreatedDate, ThisItem.ClosedDate, Hours )`
    *   **Conditional Formatting:** Set a label's `Color` property to `If( DateDiff(Today(), ThisItem.DueDate, Days) < 0, Red, Black )` to turn overdue items red.
