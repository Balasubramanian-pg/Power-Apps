### **25. What is the purpose of the Set() function?**

*   **Purpose:** The **`Set()`** function is used to create or update a **global variable**. Global variables are accessible from anywhere within the app (across all screens).
*   **Syntax:** `Set( VariableName, Value )`
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Scope:** **Global** (app-level).
    *   **Persistence:** The value persists while the app is running but is **lost when the app is closed**.
    *   **Common Use Cases:**
        *   **Storing User Selections:** `Set( varSelectedCustomer, Gallery1.Selected )` - Store a selected record for use on another screen.
        *   **Holding Calculated Values:** `Set( varTotalCost, Slider1.Value * 1.1 )` - Calculate and store a value for later use.
        *   **Tracking App State:** `Set( varIsEditing, true )` - Use a variable to show/hide controls or change modes.
    *   **How to Use:** Typically called from the `OnSelect` property of a button or the `OnStart` property of the app.
