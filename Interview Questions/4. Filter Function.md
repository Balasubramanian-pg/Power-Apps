When working with 100 desks (or 100 records) in **Power Apps**, you'll want to use the **`Filter`** function to efficiently check the status of each desk (e.g., if it's allocated or not).

Here are the best practices for this scenario, focusing on performance, which is key when dealing with data, even with just 100 records:

### 1\. Using the `Filter` Function

The `Filter` function is the standard way to retrieve a subset of records that match a specific condition. For a data source named `Desks` with a column called `Status`, you'd use a formula like this:

```powerapps
Filter(Desks, Status = "Allocated")
```

This returns a table of only the allocated desks. You can use this filtered table to display the results in a **Gallery** or to simply count them.

### 2\. Counting the Allocated Desks

To get a count of the allocated desks, you wrap the `Filter` function with the **`CountRows`** function.

```powerapps
CountRows(Filter(Desks, Status = "Allocated"))
```

This formula returns the number of desks where the `Status` column is equal to "Allocated".

### Performance Consideration: Delegation

When working with data sources like **SharePoint**, **SQL Server**, or **Dataverse**, the concept of **delegation** is crucial for performance.

  * **Delegation** means Power Apps sends the filtering work to the data source (the server), which is much faster, especially for larger datasets.
  * The `Filter` function, when using comparison operators like `=`, is **delegable** for most major data sources.
  * Since you only have **100 desks**, you are well under the non-delegable data limit (typically 500 or 2000 records, depending on settings). However, it's always best practice to use **delegable formulas** like the one above to ensure your app scales efficiently if the number of desks increases.

Avoid non-delegable functions like `Search` if `Filter` can achieve your goal, as `Search` can sometimes pull all records onto the device before filtering, leading to slowdowns.

If you need to display the status for each desk, use the original `Desks` data source as the `Items` property of a **Gallery** or **Data table**. If you only need to show the allocated ones, use the `Filter` formula as the `Items` property of a Gallery.
