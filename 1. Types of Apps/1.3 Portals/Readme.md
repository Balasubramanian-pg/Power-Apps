# Portals: External-Facing Websites for Users Outside Your Organization

- Power Apps Portals enable organizations to create external-facing websites that allow users outside the organization to interact securely with data stored in Microsoft Dataverse [web:11][web:13].
- External users can access portals either anonymously or via various authentication providers including LinkedIn, Microsoft Accounts, social logins, or enterprise systems using SAML2, OpenID Connect, and WS-Federation [web:11][web:13].
- Portals provide low-code, responsive websites that can be custom branded and designed with a dedicated portal designer, supporting pixel-perfect layouts and business needs [web:13][web:14].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Power Apps Portals extend interaction beyond internal users, enabling secure collaboration with customers, partners, suppliers, and other external stakeholders [web:11][web:16].

- Content management features include webpages, sitemaps, templates, and integration with Microsoft services like Power BI, Power Automate (Flows), SharePoint, and Azure services for enriched user experience [web:13][web:14][web:16].
- Self-service capabilities allow external users to submit requests, view personalized data, and interact dynamically with backend Dataverse data through model-driven forms, views, and dashboards embedded on the site [web:13][web:16].
- Mobile responsive design is built-in, making portals accessible on phones, tablets, laptops, or desktops without extra effort [web:16].

> [!TIP]  
> Power Apps Portals license requirements vary by user type (authenticated vs anonymous), so planning licensing is important for cost control [web:15].

> [!WARNING]  
> Portals need careful security setup to protect sensitive data while enabling external access â€” use role-based permissions and best practices for authentication [web:18].

- Advanced pro-dev extensibility options allow adding code plugins, workflows, and custom templates for sophisticated business processes beyond out-of-the-box low-code capabilities [web:13].
- Portals support integration with Power Platform for automation (Power Automate), analytics (Power BI), and enhanced UX through APIs (e.g., Portals Web API for CRUD operations without forms) [web:15][web:16].

> [!NOTE]  
> The newer Microsoft Power Pages builds upon the Power Apps Portals framework, offering enhanced ease-of-use and capabilities for external-facing sites [web:12][web:19].
