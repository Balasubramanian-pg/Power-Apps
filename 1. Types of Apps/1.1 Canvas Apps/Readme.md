# Canvas Apps: Start from Scratch, Full UI Control

- Canvas Apps allow building custom business applications with a blank canvas.
- You get full control over the user interface (UI) design, meaning you place and configure every UI element manually.
- Ideal for creating tailored experiences that deviate significantly from form-based apps or templates.

> [!NOTE]  
> Canvas Apps start from scratch involve drag-and-drop controls, allowing precise positioning and customization of buttons, text inputs, galleries, images, and more.

- You can connect to multiple data sources such as SharePoint, SQL Server, Dataverse, and others.
- Supports logic implementation using Power Fx formulas to handle interactions and data processing.
- Provides access to standard controls (labels, buttons, forms) and advanced controls (barcode scanner, media, maps).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Designing from scratch requires more planning and design effort than starting from a template or form-based app.

- Layout flexibility enables pixel-perfect custom UI designs suited for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Responsive layouts require manual configuration (e.g., relative positioning, container controls).
- All UI controls support properties like Color, Size, Visible, and OnSelect for interactivity.

> [!TIP]  
> Use screens to break down the app into logical steps or workflows, improving user experience.
> Leverage variables and context variables to manage UI states and navigation smoothly.

> [!WARNING]  
> Without careful design, apps can become cluttered or inconsistent due to total design freedom.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Performance can degrade if too many controls or complex formulas are used on a single screen; optimize when possible.

- Supports media integration (images, videos, audio) and custom branding.
- Incorporate user inputs through forms and input controls, validating data with formulas.
- Conditional formatting and dynamic visibility enhance UI responsiveness based on user actions or data state.

> [!NOTE]  
> Start from scratch canvas apps are suitable for apps where the look and feel are key differentiators and when off-the-shelf UI is insufficient.

- Frequent use of galleries and data tables for displaying lists and structured data.
- Connectors and Power Automate flows can extend functionality with backend processes.

> [!TIP]  
> Preview frequently during development using Power Apps Studio's preview mode to test user interactions and data flow.

- Deployment and sharing are similar to other Power Apps: apps can be published for mobile or web.
- Export/import capabilities allow version control and collaboration.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Security and role-based access need to be managed through data source permissions and Power Apps environment settings.

- Integration with Microsoft Power Platform services enables automation, AI, and analytics capabilities.
