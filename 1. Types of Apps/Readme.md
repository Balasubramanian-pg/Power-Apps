# Power Apps: Canvas Apps, Model-Driven Apps & Portals

## Introduction

Microsoft Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors that provides a rapid application development environment for building custom business applications. Power Apps offers three primary approaches to application development: Canvas Apps, Model-Driven Apps, and Power Pages (formerly Power Apps Portals). Each approach serves different purposes and use cases, and understanding their strengths and limitations is crucial for making the right architectural decisions.

## Canvas Apps

### Overview

Canvas Apps provide a blank canvas approach to application development, giving developers complete control over the user interface and user experience. Think of Canvas Apps as a PowerPoint-like designer where you can place controls exactly where you want them, pixel by pixel.

### Key Characteristics

**Design Philosophy**: Canvas Apps follow a "start with a blank screen" approach. You design the UI first, then connect it to data sources. This gives you maximum flexibility in creating custom user experiences that don't conform to traditional database-driven interfaces.

**Data Connectivity**: Canvas Apps can connect to over 400 data sources including:
- Microsoft Dataverse
- SharePoint
- SQL Server
- Excel
- Microsoft 365 services (Outlook, Teams, OneDrive)
- Third-party services (Salesforce, Twitter, Google services)
- Custom APIs and connectors

> [!TIP]
> Canvas Apps excel when you need to connect to multiple disparate data sources in a single application. You can pull data from SharePoint, send emails via Outlook, and update SQL Server records all within the same app.

### When to Use Canvas Apps

Canvas Apps are ideal for:
- **Task-focused applications** with specific workflows
- **Mobile-first experiences** where touch interactions are paramount
- **Applications requiring custom UI/UX** that doesn't fit traditional forms-over-data paradigms
- **Rapid prototyping** and quick wins
- **Connecting multiple heterogeneous data sources**
- **Field service applications** for mobile workers
- **Inspection and audit apps** with photo capture and signatures

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Canvas Apps have a delegation limit of 2,000 records by default when working with data sources. While this can be increased or worked around, it's a crucial consideration for applications dealing with large datasets.

### Development Experience

**Formula Language**: Canvas Apps use Power Fx, a low-code formula language similar to Excel formulas. This makes it accessible to business users familiar with Excel while still being powerful enough for complex logic.

Example Power Fx formulas:
```
// Filter a gallery based on search input
Filter(Products, StartsWith(ProductName, SearchInput.Text))

// Patch (update) a record
Patch(Customers, LookUp(Customers, ID = CustomerID), {Status: "Active"})

// Navigate with context
Navigate(DetailScreen, ScreenTransition.Fade, {SelectedItem: Gallery1.Selected})
```

**Component-Based Architecture**: Canvas Apps support reusable components, allowing you to create custom controls that can be shared across apps or even published to organizational libraries.

> [!NOTE]
> Canvas Apps support responsive design through containers and the modern controls framework, making it easier to build apps that work across different screen sizes and devices.

### Limitations and Considerations

**Performance**: Canvas Apps can face performance issues with:
- Large datasets (due to delegation limitations)
- Complex formulas that execute on every screen render
- Multiple concurrent API calls
- Heavy use of collections and global variables

**Governance**: Canvas Apps can proliferate quickly in an organization, leading to:
- Shadow IT challenges
- Difficulty in maintaining app inventory
- Version control complexities
- Limited native ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) capabilities

> [!WARNING]
> Without proper governance, Canvas Apps can become difficult to maintain. Establish naming conventions, implement maker environments, and use solutions to package apps for proper ALM.

**Licensing**: Canvas Apps require either:
- Microsoft 365 licenses (limited to standard connectors)
- Power Apps per app plan (€8.12/user/month per app)
- Power Apps per user plan (€16.90/user/month for unlimited apps)

> [!CAUTION]
> Using premium connectors (like SQL Server, on-premises data gateway, or custom connectors) requires premium licensing. Standard Microsoft 365 licenses won't suffice.

## Model-Driven Apps

### Overview

Model-Driven Apps take a fundamentally different approach from Canvas Apps. Instead of starting with a blank canvas, you start with your data model. The app's interface is automatically generated based on the Dataverse tables, relationships, business rules, and security roles you define.

### Key Characteristics

**Data-First Approach**: Model-Driven Apps are built on Microsoft Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service), which provides:
- Structured relational data storage
- Rich metadata system
- Built-in business logic (business rules, workflows, calculated fields)
- Row-level security
- Audit logging
- Complex relationship management

**Automatic UI Generation**: The system automatically generates forms, views, charts, and dashboards based on your data model. This ensures consistency and reduces development time for standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Model-Driven Apps require Microsoft Dataverse. You cannot build a Model-Driven App on SharePoint, SQL Server, or other data sources. This is a fundamental architectural requirement.

### When to Use Model-Driven Apps

Model-Driven Apps are ideal for:
- **Complex data models** with multiple related tables
- **Enterprise-grade applications** requiring robust security and scalability
- **CRM-style applications** managing customers, contacts, accounts, and opportunities
- **Case management systems** tracking incidents, requests, or tickets
- **Applications requiring rich reporting and dashboards**
- **Process-driven workflows** with approvals and automation
- **Applications where data integrity and security are paramount**

> [!TIP]
> If your application resembles a traditional database application with forms, grids, and relationships between entities, Model-Driven Apps will get you to production faster than Canvas Apps.

### Development Experience

**Declarative Development**: Much of Model-Driven App development is declarative (configuration rather than coding):
- Define tables and columns in Dataverse
- Create relationships (1:N, N:1, N:N)
- Configure forms with drag-and-drop
- Set up views and filters
- Define business rules without code
- Configure security roles and permissions

**Extensibility**: When declarative tools aren't sufficient, Model-Driven Apps support:
- JavaScript for client-side customization
- C# plugins for server-side logic
- Custom pages (Canvas pages embedded within Model-Driven Apps)
- Power Automate flows for process automation
- PCF (PowerApps Component Framework) controls for custom UI components

### Advanced Features

**Business Process Flows**: Guide users through standardized processes with visual progress indicators. Perfect for:
- Sales processes (Lead → Opportunity → Quote → Order)
- Customer onboarding workflows
- Compliance procedures
- Case resolution processes

> [!NOTE]
> Business Process Flows span across multiple forms and tables, maintaining process state and ensuring users complete all required steps.

**Role-Based Security**: Model-Driven Apps provide granular security:
- Table-level permissions
- Row-level security (via business units and ownership)
- Field-level security for sensitive data
- Hierarchical security for organizational structures

**Rich Reporting**: Native integration with:
- Built-in charts and dashboards
- Power BI embedded visualizations
- SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports
- FetchXML-based custom reports

### Limitations and Considerations

**Learning Curve**: Model-Driven Apps require understanding:
- Dataverse data modeling concepts
- Entity relationships and lookup behavior
- Security role configuration
- Form and view customization patterns

**UI Flexibility**: While highly functional, Model-Driven Apps offer less UI customization than Canvas Apps:
- Limited control over exact layout and positioning
- Standardized form appearance
- Less flexibility for mobile-optimized experiences

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't try to force Model-Driven Apps into highly custom UI scenarios. If your application requires a completely custom interface, consider Canvas Apps or embedding custom pages.

**Cost Considerations**: Model-Driven Apps require:
- Dataverse database capacity (starts at 10 GB per tenant)
- File and log storage
- Premium licensing (included in some Dynamics 365 licenses or standalone Power Apps licenses)

> [!WARNING]
> Dataverse storage costs can accumulate quickly with large file attachments or extensive audit logging. Monitor storage usage and implement retention policies.

## Power Pages (Formerly Power Apps Portals)

### Overview

Power Pages (rebranded from Power Apps Portals in 2022) are external-facing websites that allow users outside your organization to interact with Dataverse data. These are full websites with authentication, authorization, content management, and responsive design capabilities.

### Key Characteristics

**External User Access**: Power Pages enable:
- Anonymous browsing of public content
- Authenticated access for external users (customers, partners, vendors)
- Self-service portals for case management and knowledge bases
- Community forums and discussion boards
- Partner relationship management

**Built on Dataverse**: Like Model-Driven Apps, Power Pages are tightly integrated with Dataverse:
- Use Dataverse tables as the backend
- Leverage existing security roles and permissions
- Share business logic with Model-Driven Apps
- Support complex data relationships

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power Pages are designed for external users and low-code website building. They are not intended to replace internal Canvas or Model-Driven Apps for your employees.

### When to Use Power Pages

Power Pages are ideal for:
- **Customer self-service portals** for case submission and tracking
- **Partner portals** for collaboration and resource sharing
- **Community websites** with forums and knowledge bases
- **Event registration and management** websites
- **Job application portals**
- **Customer feedback and survey collection**
- **E-commerce storefronts** integrated with Dynamics 365

> [!TIP]
> Power Pages come with starter templates for common scenarios (customer self-service, partner portals, employee self-service) that provide pre-built pages and configurations.

### Development Experience

**Low-Code Website Building**: Power Pages provide:
- Drag-and-drop page designer
- Pre-built templates and themes
- Liquid template language for dynamic content
- Web forms and lists for Dataverse interaction
- Content snippets for reusable content blocks

**Portal Studio**: The modern design experience includes:
- Visual page editor
- Theme customization
- Component library
- Code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Data workspace for configuring table permissions

**Authentication Options**:
- Local authentication (username/password)
- Azure AD B2C
- OAuth 2.0 providers (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- SAML 2.0
- WS-Federation

> [!NOTE]
> External users accessing Power Pages don't count against your internal user licenses. Portal user licensing is separate and based on page views or authenticated users.

### Security Model

**Table Permissions**: Control what data external users can access:
- Create, Read, Update, Delete permissions
- Scope (Global, Contact, Account, Parent, Self)
- Web role-based access control

**Page Permissions**: Control which pages users can access:
- Anonymous access for public pages
- Authenticated access for logged-in users
- Role-based page visibility

> [!WARNING]
> Table permissions in Power Pages work differently from Dataverse security roles. You must explicitly configure table permissions for the portal, even if similar permissions exist in Dataverse for internal users.

### Advanced Capabilities

**Web Forms**: Multi-step forms that create or update Dataverse records:
- Progress indicators
- Conditional branching
- File uploads
- Digital signatures
- Validation rules

**Lists**: Display Dataverse records in tables or lists:
- Filtering and sorting
- Search functionality
- Pagination
- Actions (edit, delete, custom buttons)
- OData feed integration

**Basic Forms**: Single-step forms for simple data entry or updates

**Content Management**: 
- Web pages with WYSIWYG editor
- Content snippets for reusable content
- Web files for documents and images
- Multilingual content support

> [!TIP]
> Use content snippets for frequently used text (like company addresses or disclaimers) that might change. You can update the snippet once and it reflects across all pages.

### Limitations and Considerations

**Performance**: Power Pages are public-facing websites and must consider:
- Page load times for anonymous users
- CDN configuration for static assets
- Caching strategies
- Dataverse API call limitations

**Customization Complexity**: While low-code for simple scenarios, advanced customization requires:
- Liquid template language knowledge
- CSS and JavaScript skills
- Understanding of portal architecture
- Power Platform development experience

> [!CAUTION]
> Over-customization of Power Pages can make future upgrades difficult. Stick to supported customization methods and avoid modifying core portal components when possible.

**Licensing**: Power Pages licensing is complex:
- Capacity-based licensing (page views per month)
- Authenticated user licensing (per user per month)
- Add-on capacity packs available
- Different pricing tiers based on features needed

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power Pages require their own licensing separate from Canvas and Model-Driven Apps. A standard Power Apps license doesn't include portal capabilities.

**Search Limitations**: Portal search is powered by Dataverse search, which:
- Requires configuration and setup
- Has indexing delays (not real-time)
- Limited customization of search relevance
- May require additional configuration for optimal results

## Integration and Coexistence

### Combining App Types

> [!TIP]
> You don't have to choose just one app type. Many successful Power Platform solutions combine multiple app types to leverage their respective strengths.

**Canvas Apps + Model-Driven Apps**:
- Embed Canvas Apps as custom pages within Model-Driven Apps
- Use Canvas Apps for mobile field workers, Model-Driven Apps for office staff
- Build custom dashboards in Canvas Apps that read from Dataverse

**Model-Driven Apps + Power Pages**:
- External users submit requests via Power Pages
- Internal staff process requests in Model-Driven Apps
- Shared Dataverse tables ensure data consistency

**All Three Together**:
- Customers submit cases via Power Pages
- Field technicians use Canvas Apps on mobile devices
- Back-office staff manage cases in Model-Driven Apps
- All connected to the same Dataverse instance

### Power Automate Integration

All three app types integrate seamlessly with Power Automate for:
- Automated workflows
- Scheduled processes
- Approval routing
- Notifications and alerts
- Integration with external systems

### Common Data Foundation

> [!NOTE]
> Using Dataverse as the common data platform for all your apps ensures data consistency, reduces integration complexity, and enables powerful reporting across applications.

## Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)

### Solutions

All three app types can be packaged into Dataverse solutions:
- Bundle apps, flows, tables, and other components
- Export solutions from development environments
- Import into test and production environments
- Manage dependencies between components

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Implement a proper ALM strategy from the start. Moving apps between environments without solutions can lead to broken dependencies and data loss.

### Environment Strategy

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Development**: Makers build and test apps
2. **Testing/UAT**: Stakeholders validate functionality
3. **Production**: End users access live apps

> [!WARNING]
> Never develop directly in production. Always use separate development environments and promote changes through formal deployment processes.

### Version Control

**Canvas Apps**: 
- Built-in version history (limited)
- Power Platform CLI for source control integration
- Git integration for team development

**Model-Driven Apps**: 
- Managed through solutions
- Solution history tracking
- Export/import with version control

**Power Pages**: 
- Portal configuration stored in Dataverse
- Can be exported with solutions
- Custom code (Liquid, JS, CSS) should be version controlled separately

## Governance and Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Establish consistent naming for:
- Apps (e.g., `[Department]_[Function]_[AppType]`)
- Dataverse tables (e.g., `contoso_Project`)
- Connections and data sources
- Environments

> [!TIP]
> Prefix custom Dataverse tables with your organization or solution name to avoid conflicts and make them easily identifiable.

### Security Best Practices

**Canvas Apps**:
- Share apps with security groups, not individuals
- Use least-privilege access to data sources
- Implement app-level auditing
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations

**Model-Driven Apps**:
- Design security roles following least-privilege principle
- Use business units for organizational segmentation
- Enable field-level security for sensitive data
- Implement audit logging for compliance

**Power Pages**:
- Configure table permissions explicitly
- Use authenticated access for sensitive operations
- Implement proper authentication (prefer Azure AD B2C)
- Regular security reviews of exposed data

> [!CAUTION]
> Default table permissions in Power Pages deny all access. You must explicitly grant permissions, which is a security best practice but can be overlooked during development.

### Performance Optimization

**Canvas Apps**:
- Use delegation-friendly functions
- Minimize use of collections
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize images and media
- Use concurrent functions for parallel API calls

**Model-Driven Apps**:
- Optimize form load with selective field loading
- Use calculated fields instead of JavaScript when possible
- Implement efficient FetchXML queries
- Leverage views for pre-filtered data

**Power Pages**:
- Enable CDN for static assets

   - Internal staff → Canvas or Model-Driven
   - External customers/partners → Power Pages
   - Both → Combination approach

2. **What's your data structure?**
   - Simple, few tables, multiple sources → Canvas
   - Complex, many relationships, single source → Model-Driven
   - Need to expose existing Dataverse data externally → Power Pages

3. **What's your UI requirement?**
   - Highly custom, brand-specific → Canvas or Power Pages
   - Standard forms and grids → Model-Driven
   - Public website → Power Pages

4. **What's your timeline?**
   - Need it quickly, simple requirements → Canvas
   - Complex but standard data app → Model-Driven
   - External portal, have time for setup → Power Pages

5. **What's your scale?**
   - Small dataset, limited users → Canvas
   - Large dataset, many users, complex security → Model-Driven
   - Public access, unknown user count → Power Pages

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's no "best" app type—only the best fit for your specific requirements. Take time to evaluate your needs against each app type's strengths.
