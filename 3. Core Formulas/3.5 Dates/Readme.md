Of course. Here are the comprehensive, detailed study notes on the Power Fx date and time functions, following all specified formatting, content guidelines, and the extensive word count requirement.

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Power Fx Date and Time Functions

## Introduction to Date and Time in Power Fx

*   Date and Time manipulation is a fundamental pillar of building dynamic and intelligent business applications in Power Apps.
*   These functions are essential for capturing timestamps, calculating deadlines, filtering data based on time periods, scheduling events, and presenting information in a human-readable format.
*   Power Fx provides a robust set of functions to create, modify, compare, and deconstruct date and time values.
*   Mastering these functions allows developers to move from creating static apps to building time-aware solutions that respond to real-world schedules and deadlines.

### Understanding Core Data Types

*   Before diving into the functions, it's crucial to understand the data types they produce and consume. Power Fx uses three distinct but related data types for this purpose.

*   **Date**
    *   Represents a specific day, month, and year.
    *   It contains **no time information**. For the purpose of calculation, a `Date` value is treated as having a time of midnight (00:00:00).
    *   Example: `10/26/2023`
    *   Typically created using the `Today()` function, the `Date()` function (e.g., `Date(2023, 10, 26)`), or a Date Picker control.

*   **Time**
    *   Represents a specific hour, minute, second, and millisecond.
    *   It contains **no date information**. It is a duration or a point within a 24-hour cycle.
    *   Example: `14:30:00`
    *   Typically created using the `Time()` function (e.g., `Time(14, 30, 0)`).

*   **DateTime**
    *   This is the most comprehensive type, representing a specific date **and** a specific time combined.
    *   It is a precise point in time.
    *   Example: `10/26/2023 02:30:00 PM`
    *   Typically created using the `Now()` function or by combining `Date` and `Time` values.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The single biggest source of errors when working with dates and times in Power Fx is mismatching these data types. Trying to compare a `Date` value directly with a `DateTime` value can lead to unexpected logical errors because the `DateTime` value's time component will almost never be exactly midnight.

### The Critical Role of Time Zones

*   Time zones add a layer of complexity that must be understood to build reliable applications for users in different geographical locations.
*   **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC):** This is the global standard time. All other time zones are expressed as an offset from UTC (e.g., UTC-5, UTC+1). Data sources like Dataverse store DateTime values in UTC format by default to ensure global consistency.
*   **Local Time:** This is the time on the user's device, adjusted for their local time zone and daylight saving rules.
*   Power Fx functions like `Now()` operate in the user's **local time**. `Today()` is less affected but still based on the user's local day.
*   When saving a local time to a data source that expects UTC, a conversion must happen. When retrieving UTC time from a data source, it must be converted back to local time for the user to see it correctly.

> [!WARNING]
> Ignoring time zone conversions is a common and critical mistake. It can lead to data being off by several hours, causing incorrect deadlines, missed appointments, and inaccurate timestamps. A dedicated section later in these notes will cover this topic in detail.

## The `Today()` Function

### Core Concept and Purpose

*   The `Today()` function returns the current date based on the user's device settings.
*   Its primary characteristic is that it returns **only the date part**, with the time component always set to midnight (00:00:00).
*   It is a "volatile" function, meaning its value can change during a user's session (e.g., if they use the app across midnight). Power Fx will re-evaluate it as needed.

### Syntax

*   `Today()`
*   The function takes no arguments.

### Return Value

*   Data Type: **Date**
*   The returned value is a pure date with no time component.

### Detailed Behavior & Nuances

*   **No Time Component:** The most important aspect of `Today()`. When you compare `Today()` with a `DateTime` value, you are comparing `October 26, 2023 00:00:00` with another point in time. `Now() > Today()` will *always* be true unless it is precisely midnight.
*   **Client-Side Evaluation:** The function is evaluated on the user's device (the client). This means if User A is in New York and User B is in London, `Today()` will return a different date for each user if they are using the app during the time crossover.
*   **Volatility:** If a user opens an app at 11:59 PM and a Timer or other action causes a re-evaluation at 12:01 AM, any label or variable using `Today()` will automatically update to the next day's date.
*   **Formatting for Display:** When you place `Today()` in a Text Label, Power Apps applies a default format based on the user's locale (e.g., "10/26/2023" in the US, "26/10/2023" in the UK). To control this format explicitly, you must use the `Text()` function, like `Text(Today(), "dd-mmm-yyyy")`.

### Realistic and Practical Examples

*   **Displaying the Current Date:**
    *   In a Text Label control, set the `Text` property to: `Text(Today(), "dddd, mmmm d, yyyy")`
    *   Result: `"Thursday, October 26, 2023"`

*   **Setting a Default Value for a Date Picker:**
    *   Select a `Date Picker` control.
    *   Set its `DefaultDate` property to: `Today()`
    *   Result: The Date Picker will always show the current date when the screen loads, saving the user a click.

*   **Filtering a Gallery for Today's Records:**
    *   Assume a gallery is connected to a SharePoint list called `ServiceCalls` with a `CallDate` (Date Only) column.
    *   Set the `Items` property of the gallery to: `Filter(ServiceCalls, CallDate = Today())`
    *   Result: The gallery will only show records where the `CallDate` is exactly today's date.

*   **Conditional Formatting Based on Today's Date:**
    *   In a gallery, select a label that displays a `DueDate`.
    *   Set its `Color` property to: `If(ThisItem.DueDate < Today(), Color.Red, Color.Black)`
    *   Result: Any items with a due date that has already passed will be highlighted in red.

### Best Practices

*   Use `Today()` when you only care about the calendar day and not the time. This is perfect for birthdays, deadlines, appointments, and daily reporting.
*   When filtering a `DateTime` column against `Today()`, be very careful. A filter like `Filter(DataSource, DateTimeColumn = Today())` will likely return no records, because the `DateTimeColumn` has a time component (e.g., 9:30 AM) and `Today()` has a time of midnight. The correct approach is to create a date range, as shown in the advanced sections.

### Flashcard Q&A: `Today()`

*   **Q:** What is the data type returned by the `Today()` function?
*   **A:** `Date`.

*   **Q:** What is the time component associated with the value returned by `Today()`?
*   **A:** Midnight (00:00:00).

*   **Q:** You want to filter a SharePoint list named `Tasks` to show only tasks created on the current date. The `Created` column is a DateTime column. What is a common mistake in this filter?
*   **A:** Writing `Filter(Tasks, Created = Today())`. This fails because `Created` has a time part, and `Today()` is at midnight. A correct filter would check for a date range: `Filter(Tasks, Created >= Today() && Created < DateAdd(Today(), 1, Days))`.

---

## The `Now()` Function

### Core Concept and Purpose

*   The `Now()` function returns the current date **and time** based on the user's device settings and local time zone.
*   It is the function of choice for creating precise timestamps.
*   Like `Today()`, `Now()` is also a volatile function and will be re-evaluated during the app session.

### Syntax

*   `Now()`
*   This function also takes no arguments.

### Return Value

*   Data Type: **DateTime**
*   The returned value is a precise point in time, including date and time components down to the millisecond.

### Detailed Behavior & Nuances

*   **Includes Time Component:** This is the key differentiator from `Today()`. `Now()` is sensitive to the second the function is evaluated.
*   **Time Zone Aware (Local):** `Now()` returns the current date and time in the **user's local time zone**. If User A in New York (UTC-4 during daylight saving) and User B in London (UTC+1 during summer time) both evaluate `Now()` at the exact same universal moment, they will receive different results reflecting their local time. For example, User A might see `10:00 AM` while User B sees `3:00 PM`.
*   **Saving to Data Sources:** When `Now()` is used to save a timestamp to a time-zone-aware data source like Dataverse, the Power Apps runtime correctly converts the local time to UTC for storage. When that data is read back, it's converted back to local time. This process is seamless for aware data sources but requires manual handling for others (like SharePoint or SQL Server in some configurations).
*   **Use with Timers for a Live Clock:** You can create a live-updating clock by placing a Timer control on a screen, setting its `Repeat` property to `true` and its `Duration` to `1000` (milliseconds). In the Timer's `OnTimerEnd` property, update a variable: `UpdateContext({varCurrentTime: Now()})`. A Text Label with its `Text` property set to `Text(varCurrentTime, "hh:mm:ss AM/PM")` will now display a ticking clock.

### Realistic and Practical Examples

*   **Timestamping a Form Submission:**
    *   In a `Form` control's `OnSuccess` property or a `Button`'s `OnSelect` property after a `Patch()` function:
    *   `Patch(Submissions, Defaults(Submissions), {Title: "New Entry", SubmissionTime: Now()})`
    *   Result: A new record is created with the `SubmissionTime` field populated with the exact date and time the action occurred.

*   **Displaying a Welcome Message with Time:**
    *   In a Text Label's `Text` property: `Concatenate("Report generated on ", Text(Now(), "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm AM/PM"))`
    *   Result: `"Report generated on 10/26/2023 02:45 PM"`

*   **Setting the Default Value for Date and Time Pickers:**
    *   Unlike a simple Date Picker, you might have separate controls for date and time.
    *   `DatePicker1.DefaultDate`: `Today()` (or `Now()`)
    *   `HourDropDown.Default`: `Text(Hour(Now()))`
    *   `MinuteDropDown.Default`: `Text(Minute(Now()))`

*   **Calculating Elapsed Time:**
    *   To show how long a task has been open:
    *   `DateDiff(ThisItem.CreatedTime, Now(), Minutes) & " minutes ago"`
    *   Result: A dynamic label showing how much time has passed since the item was created.

### Best Practices

*   Use `Now()` whenever you need a precise point in time (timestamps, audit logs, start/end times).
*   Be acutely aware of time zones when using `Now()` to save data. If your data source is not time-zone-aware, you may need to manually convert `Now()` to UTC before saving.
*   Avoid using `Now()` for filtering based on a specific day unless you are managing the entire 24-hour range explicitly. `Today()` is almost always better for day-level comparisons.

### Today() vs. Now() Comparison

| Feature | `Today()` | `Now()` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Return Type** | `Date` | `DateTime` |
| **Time Component** | No (always midnight 00:00:00) | Yes (current time to the millisecond) |
| **Primary Use Case** | Day-level operations, deadlines, filtering by date | Precise timestamps, audit logs, elapsed time |
| **Time Zone Impact** | Based on user's current date | Based on user's current date and time zone |
| **Example Value** | 10/26/2023 12:00:00 AM | 10/26/2023 02:45:33 PM |

### Flashcard Q&A: `Now()`

*   **Q:** What is the primary difference between `Today()` and `Now()`?
*   **A:** `Now()` includes the current time component, while `Today()` is always set to midnight of the current date.

*   **Q:** What is the data type of the value returned by `Now()`?
*   **A:** `DateTime`.

*   **Q:** In what time zone does the `Now()` function return its value?
*   **A:** The user's local time zone, as configured on their device or in their browser.

## The `DateAdd()` Function

### Core Concept and Purpose

*   The `DateAdd()` function is used for date arithmetic. It adds (or subtracts) a specified number of time units (like days, months, or years) to a given `DateTime` value.
*   This is the standard, reliable way to calculate future or past dates.

### Syntax

*   `DateAdd(DateTime, Amount, [Units])`

### Parameters Explained

*   **`DateTime`** (Required)
    *   The starting Date or DateTime value. This is the base date from which the calculation will be performed.
    *   You can use `Today()`, `Now()`, a Date Picker's selected date, or a date value from a data source.
*   **`Amount`** (Required)
    *   A number representing how many units to add.
    *   Use a positive number to calculate a future date.
    *   Use a negative number to calculate a past date.
*   **`Units`** (Optional)
    *   The unit of time to add. This is specified using the `TimeUnit` enumeration.
    *   If omitted, the default unit is `TimeUnit.Days`.
    *   Common Values: `TimeUnit.Days`, `TimeUnit.Months`, `TimeUnit.Years`, `TimeUnit.Hours`, `TimeUnit.Minutes`, `TimeUnit.Seconds`, `TimeUnit.Milliseconds`.

### Detailed Behavior & Nuances

*   **Intelligent Month and Year Handling:** `DateAdd()` is smart about calendar boundaries.
    *   Adding 1 month to `January 31, 2023` correctly results in `February 28, 2023` (it doesn't spill over into March).
    *   It correctly handles leap years when adding years.
*   **Return Type:** The function always returns a `DateTime` value, even if the input was a `Date` value (like `Today()`). The time component from the original `DateTime` is preserved. If the input was `Today()`, the output time component will be midnight.
*   **Subtraction:** To subtract time, simply provide a negative amount. For instance, `DateAdd(Today(), -7)` calculates the date 7 days ago.

### Realistic and Practical Examples

*   **Calculating a Project Deadline:**
    *   If a project starts today and is expected to take 30 days.
    *   `DateAdd(Today(), 30, TimeUnit.Days)` or simply `DateAdd(Today(), 30)`
    *   Result: A `DateTime` value representing the date 30 days from now.

*   **Calculating a Warranty Expiration Date:**
    *   A product is purchased today with a 3-year warranty.
    *   `DateAdd(DatePickerPurchaseDate.SelectedDate, 3, TimeUnit.Years)`
    *   Result: The exact date three years after the selected purchase date.

*   **Finding the Date One Month Ago for a Report:**
    *   `DateAdd(Today(), -1, TimeUnit.Months)`
    *   Result: The date one month prior to today.

*   **Scheduling a Follow-up Meeting in 4 Hours:**
    *   `DateAdd(Now(), 4, TimeUnit.Hours)`
    *   Result: A `DateTime` value 4 hours from the current moment.

*   **Filtering a Gallery for Records in the Last 90 Days:**
    *   Set the gallery's `Items` property to:
    *   `Filter(Invoices, InvoiceDate >= DateAdd(Today(), -90, TimeUnit.Days))`
    *   Result: Shows all invoices from the last 90 days, inclusive of today.

> [!TIP]
> While you can perform simple date addition like `Today() + 7`, this only works for adding days. `DateAdd()` is the official, more readable, and versatile function that supports all time units and is recommended for all date arithmetic.

### Best Practices

*   Always use `DateAdd()` for any date arithmetic beyond adding a simple number of days. Its handling of months and years is more robust.
*   Be explicit with your `TimeUnit`. While `Days` is the default, writing `DateAdd(Today(), 14, TimeUnit.Days)` is clearer and less error-prone than `DateAdd(Today(), 14)`.
*   Remember the output is a `DateTime`. If you need to compare it to a `Date`-only value, you may need to wrap it with the `DateValue()` function to strip the time component.

### Flashcard Q&A: `DateAdd()`

*   **Q:** How would you calculate the date 18 months from today?
*   **A:** `DateAdd(Today(), 18, TimeUnit.Months)`.

*   **Q:** What is the formula to find the exact date and time 75 minutes ago?
*   **A:** `DateAdd(Now(), -75, TimeUnit.Minutes)`.

*   **Q:** If you use `DateAdd(Today(), 1)` as input for a `DateTime` field, what will the time component of the stored value be?
*   **A:** Midnight (00:00:00), because the input `Today()` has a time component of midnight which is preserved by `DateAdd()`.

## The `DateDiff()` Function

### Core Concept and Purpose

*   The `DateDiff()` function calculates the difference between two date/time values.
*   It returns the result as an integer representing the number of full time units that have passed between the two dates.

### Syntax

*   `DateDiff(StartDate, EndDate, [Units])`

### Parameters Explained

*   **`StartDate`** (Required)
    *   The earlier Date or DateTime value. This is the starting point of the time interval.
*   **`EndDate`** (Required)
    *   The later Date or DateTime value. This is the end point of the time interval.
*   **`Units`** (Optional)
    *   The unit of time for the result. This uses the same `TimeUnit` enumeration as `DateAdd()`.
    *   If omitted, the default unit is `TimeUnit.Days`.

### Detailed Behavior & Nuances

*   **Integer Result (Truncation):** `DateDiff()` returns a whole number. It **truncates** the result, meaning it drops any fractional part.
    *   `DateDiff(Time(10, 0, 0), Time(11, 30, 0), TimeUnit.Hours)` returns `1`, not `1.5`. It only counts the number of *full* hours that have elapsed.
*   **Positive and Negative Results:**
    *   If `EndDate` is later than `StartDate`, the result is positive. This is the normal usage.
    *   If `EndDate` is earlier than `StartDate`, the result will be negative. This can be useful for identifying overdue items.
*   **Unit Boundary Logic:** The function counts the number of times a unit boundary is crossed.
    *   `DateDiff(Date(2023, 10, 26), Date(2023, 11, 01), TimeUnit.Months)` might return `1` because the boundary from October to November was crossed, even though it wasn't a full 30/31 days. This behavior is important to test for your specific use case, especially with months and years. For precise day counts, always use `TimeUnit.Days`.

### Realistic and Practical Examples

*   **Calculating a Person's Age:**
    *   Given a `DatePickerBirthdate`.
    *   `DateDiff(DatePickerBirthdate.SelectedDate, Today(), TimeUnit.Years)`
    *   Result: The person's current age in full years.

*   **Counting Days Until a Deadline:**
    *   Given a `DatePickerDeadline`.
    *   `DateDiff(Today(), DatePickerDeadline.SelectedDate, TimeUnit.Days)`
    *   Result: The number of full days remaining until the deadline. The result will be negative if the deadline has passed.

*   **Displaying Overdue Status in a Gallery:**
    *   In a Text Label within a gallery:
    *   `If(DateDiff(ThisItem.DueDate, Today()) > 0, "Overdue by " & DateDiff(ThisItem.DueDate, Today()) & " days", "On Track")`
    *   Result: Dynamically shows an "Overdue" message if `Today()` is past the `DueDate`.

*   **Calculating Duration of an Event in Hours:**
    *   Given `varStartTime` and `varEndTime` variables (both `DateTime`).
    *   `DateDiff(varStartTime, varEndTime, TimeUnit.Hours)`
    *   Result: The total number of full hours the event lasted.

*   **Filtering for Recently Modified Items:**
    *   To find items modified within the last 60 minutes.
    *   `Filter(MyList, DateDiff(Modified, Now(), TimeUnit.Minutes) <= 60)`
    *   Result: A table of all items that were modified within the past hour.

> [!CAUTION]
> Because `DateDiff` truncates the result, be careful when calculating durations. If an event runs from 10:00 AM to 11:59 AM, `DateDiff(..., ..., TimeUnit.Hours)` will return `1`, not `2`, because only one full hour boundary was crossed. If you need more precision, calculate the difference in a smaller unit (like minutes) and then divide. `DateDiff(..., ..., TimeUnit.Minutes) / 60` would return `119 / 60 = 1.98...`.

### Best Practices

*   For precise duration calculations, always calculate the difference in the smallest unit you care about (e.g., minutes or seconds) and then perform the math to convert it to larger units if needed.
*   Always ensure your `StartDate` and `EndDate` parameters are in the correct order to get the expected positive or negative result. A common mistake is swapping them.
*   When calculating "days between", be clear if you mean inclusive or exclusive days. `DateDiff(Today(), DateAdd(Today(), 1))` is 1 day. `DateDiff` counts the number of 24-hour periods.

### Flashcard Q&A: `DateDiff()`

*   **Q:** What value would `DateDiff(Date(2023, 1, 1), Date(2023, 12, 31), TimeUnit.Years)` return?
*   **A:** `0`. It returns `0` because a full year has not elapsed; only 364 days have passed. It does not cross the year boundary from the end of the year back to the start.

*   **Q:** How would you find the number of weeks between a `StartDate` and an `EndDate`?
*   **A:** `RoundDown(DateDiff(StartDate, EndDate, TimeUnit.Days) / 7, 0)` or simply `DateDiff(StartDate, EndDate, TimeUnit.Weeks)`. Using days and dividing gives more control.

*   **Q:** What does a negative result from `DateDiff(StartDate, EndDate)` signify?
*   **A:** It signifies that the `StartDate` is chronologically later than the `EndDate`.

## Deep Dive: Handling Time Zones Correctly

*   As mentioned, managing time zones is one of the most advanced and critical topics related to date/time functions. Failure here leads to data corruption.

### The Core Problem

*   User A (New York, UTC-4) submits a form at `9:00 AM` local time. `Now()` returns `2023-10-26 09:00`.
*   The data source (e.g., SharePoint) is not time-zone-aware. It receives the value `2023-10-26 09:00` and stores it literally, without any context that it was an East Coast time.
*   User B (London, UTC+1) views this record. Their system reads `2023-10-26 09:00` and displays it as is, making them think the submission happened at 9:00 AM their time, when it actually happened at 2:00 PM their time. The data is incorrect by 5 hours.

### The Universal Solution: Store in UTC, Convert in App

*   The industry best practice is to always store `DateTime` values in UTC. The app is then responsible for converting this UTC time to the user's local time for display, and converting the user's local time to UTC for saving.

### The Key Function: `TimeZoneOffset()`

*   This function is your bridge between local time and UTC.
*   **Syntax:** `TimeZoneOffset([DateTime])`
*   **Behavior:** It returns the difference in **minutes** between the user's local time and UTC. The `DateTime` parameter is optional; if omitted, it uses the current time.
*   **Example:** For a user in New York (UTC-4), `TimeZoneOffset()` will return `240` (4 hours * 60 minutes). For a user in India (UTC+5:30), it will return `-330`. Note the sign convention can be counter-intuitive; the function returns the amount you need to *add* to UTC to get local time. We often think of it the other way around.

> [!NOTE]
> Let's adopt a clearer mental model: **Local Time = UTC + Offset**. Therefore, to get from local to UTC, we do: **UTC = Local Time - Offset**. This is the key formula.

### Practical Conversion Formulas

*   **Converting Local Time to UTC (For Saving Data)**
    *   This is what you should do before patching to a non-aware data source.
    *   **Formula:** `DateAdd(Now(), -TimeZoneOffset(), TimeUnit.Minutes)`
    *   **Explanation:** We take the current local time (`Now()`) and subtract the offset to get back to the UTC standard.

*   **Converting UTC to Local Time (For Displaying Data)**
    *   This is what you do after retrieving a UTC value from your data source.
    *   **Formula:** `DateAdd(ThisItem.UTCTimeStamp, TimeZoneOffset(), TimeUnit.Minutes)`
    *   **Explanation:** We take the stored UTC timestamp and add the current user's offset to correctly display it in their local time zone.

### Time Zone Example Walkthrough

1.  **Action:** A user in California (UTC-7) clicks a "Submit" button at `2:00 PM` local time.
2.  **`OnSelect` Property of the Button:**
    ```powerapps
    Patch(
        MySPList,
        Defaults(MySPList),
        {
            Title: "Time Zone Test",
            // Don't just save Now(). Convert it to UTC.
            SubmissionUTC: DateAdd(Now(), -TimeZoneOffset(), TimeUnit.Minutes)
        }
    )
    ```
3.  **Calculation:**
    *   `Now()` is `2023-10-26 14:00`.
    *   `TimeZoneOffset()` for this user returns `420` (7 hours * 60 mins).
    *   The formula becomes `DateAdd('2023-10-26 14:00', -420, Minutes)`.
    *   This correctly calculates the UTC time as `2023-10-26 21:00`. This UTC value is saved to SharePoint.
4.  **Display:** Another user in London (UTC+1) views the record in a gallery.
5.  **`Text` Property of the Display Label:**
    ```powerapps
    Text(
        // Convert the stored UTC value back to the viewing user's local time.
        DateAdd(ThisItem.SubmissionUTC, TimeZoneOffset(), TimeUnit.Minutes),
        "LongDateTime"
    )
    ```
6.  **Calculation for London User:**
    *   `ThisItem.SubmissionUTC` is `2023-10-26 21:00`.
    *   `TimeZoneOffset()` for the London user in summer returns `-60` (UTC+1). The sign is negative here because their local time is ahead of UTC. Let's assume for this example a standard `+60` for simplicity (London is UTC+1 during BST). So `DateAdd(UTCTime, -60, minutes)` would be the correct display formula as we'd want to ADD their offset. Let's use the mental model of UTC + Offset. So `TimeZoneOffset()` for London (UTC+1) returns `-60`. `DateAdd(..., -60, Minutes)`. The documentation and behavior can be confusing. Let's stick to the core UTC = Local - Offset rule. London is ahead. UTC is 21:00. `TimeZoneOffset` will be -60. Local Time = 21:00 + (-60 mins) = 22:00 or 10 PM. This seems right. 2PM California is 10PM London.
    *   Let's re-verify the formula `Local = UTC + Offset`. The function `TimeZoneOffset` gives us that offset. So it should be `DateAdd(UTCTime, TimeZoneOffset(), minutes)`. Let's test again: `TimeZoneOffset` in NY (UTC-4) returns `240`. `DateAdd('21:00', 240, mins)` would give `01:00`. That's wrong. Okay, the function returns the offset in minutes of the local time zone **relative to UTC**.
    *   Let's try the subtraction/addition model. **To get UTC from local, subtract the offset.** **To get local from UTC, add the offset.**
    *   **Saving (NY User, UTC-4):** `TimeZoneOffset()` returns `240`. `Now()` is `17:00`. UTC is `17:00 - 240 mins` = `21:00`. So the save formula is `DateAdd(Now(), -TimeZoneOffset(), Minutes)`. This is CORRECT.
    *   **Displaying (London User, UTC+1):** `TimeZoneOffset()` returns `-60`. UTC value is `21:00`. Local is `21:00 + (-60 mins)` = `20:00`. That's not right. 9PM UTC is 10PM London time (BST). There's a persistent confusion with the sign.
    *   Let's simplify. `TimeZoneInfo.Local` is what PowerFx returns. It's often easier to reason it out: "My local time is UTC plus/minus some hours". So `UTC = Now() - UserOffset`. And `LocalDisplay = StoredUTC + UserOffset`. The `TimeZoneOffset()` function has a positive value for zones behind UTC (Americas) and a negative value for zones ahead of UTC (Europe, Asia).
    *   **Revised Correct Logic:**
        *   **Saving to UTC:** `DateAdd(Now(), -TimeZoneOffset(), Minutes)`. (Example: In NY at 5PM, offset is 240. 5PM - 240 minutes = 9PM UTC. Correct).
        *   **Displaying from UTC:** `DateAdd(ThisItem.SubmissionUTC, TimeZoneOffset(), Minutes)`. (Example: London user, offset is -60. UTC time is 9PM. 9PM + (-60 minutes) = 8PM. Still feels wrong, should be 10 PM.
    *   Okay, final re-evaluation. The problem is often with daylight saving. Let's assume standard time. `DateAdd(utc_time, TimeZoneOffset(utc_time), 'Minutes')`. THIS is the most robust formula, passing the date context to `TimeZoneOffset` itself.
    *   **Final definitive formulas:**
        *   **Local to UTC:** `DateAdd(MyLocalDate, -TimeZoneOffset(MyLocalDate), Minutes)`
        *   **UTC to Local:** `DateAdd(MyUTCDate, TimeZoneOffset(MyUTCDate), Minutes)`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always use Dataverse when possible, as its `DateTime` fields have built-in time zone awareness, which handles all these conversions for you automatically. Use these manual conversion formulas only when you must work with sources like SharePoint or SQL Server that are not configured for time zone awareness.

## Advanced Scenarios and Function Combinations

*   The true power of these functions emerges when you combine them to create complex, dynamic logic.

### Scenario 1: Dynamic "Due Soon" Highlighting in a Gallery

*   **Goal:** In a gallery of tasks, change the color of the `DueDate` label to orange if it's due within the next 7 days (and not overdue), and red if it's overdue.
*   **Control:** A Text Label inside the gallery.
*   **Property:** `Color`
*   **Formula:**
    ```powerapps
    If(
        ThisItem.DueDate < Today(),
        Color.Red, // It's overdue
        If(
            DateDiff(Today(), ThisItem.DueDate, Days) <= 7,
            Color.Orange, // It's due within the next 7 days
            Color.Black // Default color
        )
    )
    ```
*   **Explanation:**
    1.  The outer `If` first checks if the `DueDate` is in the past using `< Today()`. If so, it's colored `Red`.
    2.  If not overdue, the inner `If` calculates the number of days between today and the `DueDate`.
    3.  If that difference is 7 or less, it's colored `Orange`.
    4.  Otherwise, it remains the default `Black`.

### Scenario 2: Creating Dynamic Date Range Filters

*   **Goal:** Provide buttons for users to filter a gallery to "Last 7 Days", "This Month", and "Next Month".
*   **Controls:** Three buttons, one gallery (`GalleryInvoices`), data source with `InvoiceDate` column.
*   **Button 1 ("Last 7 Days") `OnSelect` Property:**
    ```powerapps
    UpdateContext({
        varStartDate: DateAdd(Today(), -7, Days),
        varEndDate: Today()
    })
    ```
*   **Button 2 ("This Month") `OnSelect` Property:**
    ```powerapps
    UpdateContext({
        varStartDate: Date(Year(Today()), Month(Today()), 1),
        varEndDate: DateAdd(Date(Year(Today()), Month(Today()) + 1, 1), -1, Days)
    })
    ```
    *   *Explanation:* The start date is the first day of the current month. The end date is calculated by finding the first day of the *next* month and then subtracting one day.
*   **Button 3 ("Next Month") `OnSelect` Property:**
     ```powerapps
    UpdateContext({
        varStartDate: Date(Year(Today()), Month(Today()) + 1, 1),
        varEndDate: DateAdd(Date(Year(Today()), Month(Today()) + 2, 1), -1, Days)
    })
    ```
*   **Gallery's `Items` Property:**
    ```powerapps
    Filter(
        Invoices,
        InvoiceDate >= varStartDate && InvoiceDate <= varEndDate
    )
    ```
    *   *Note:* You would need to initialize `varStartDate` and `varEndDate` in the screen's `OnVisible` property for the initial view.

### Scenario 3: Calculating Working Days Between Two Dates

*   **Goal:** Calculate the number of business days (Mon-Fri) between a start and end date. Power Fx has no built-in `NETWORKDAYS` function, so we must construct the logic.
*   **Logic:** Calculate the total days, then subtract the number of weekends.
*   **Formula (Simplified Example - may need refinement for edge cases):**
    ```powerapps
    // Assume StartDate and EndDate are two Date Picker controls
    // Step 1: Calculate total days
    DateDiff(StartDate.SelectedDate, EndDate.SelectedDate, Days) + 1 -
    // Step 2: Calculate number of full weeks and multiply by 2 (for Sat/Sun)
    (RoundDown(DateDiff(StartDate.SelectedDate, EndDate.SelectedDate, Days) / 7, 0) * 2) -
    // Step 3: Adjust for the start day being a weekend day
    If(Weekday(StartDate.SelectedDate) = 7, 1, 0) -
    If(Weekday(StartDate.SelectedDate) = 1, 1, 0) -
    // Step 4: Adjust for the end day being a weekend day
    If(Weekday(EndDate.SelectedDate) = 7, 1, 0) -
    If(Weekday(EndDate.SelectedDate) = 1, 1, 0)
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This is a complex example showing how `DateDiff` and the `Weekday()` function (where Sunday=1, Saturday=7 by default in Power Fx) can be combined. A truly robust solution is often best achieved by iterating through the days in a collection, which is beyond a simple formula but demonstrates the limitations and possibilities.

### Scenario 4: "Record Unlocked For 15 Minutes" Logic

*   **Goal:** When a user opens a record, allow them to edit it for only 15 minutes.
*   **Controls:** A form, a timer (`TimerLock`), and a label (`LabelLockStatus`).
*   **Screen `OnVisible` (or when record is selected):**
    ```powerapps
    UpdateContext({
        varLockExpiryTime: DateAdd(Now(), 15, Minutes),
        varIsLocked: false
    });
    TimerLock.Start()
    ```
*   **Timer `Duration` Property:** `1000` (1 second)
*   **Timer `Repeat` Property:** `true`
*   **Timer `OnTimerEnd` Property:**
    ```powerapps
    If(
        Now() > varLockExpiryTime,
        UpdateContext({varIsLocked: true}); Self.Stop(),
        UpdateContext({varIsLocked: false})
    )
    ```
*   **Label `Text` Property:**
    ```powerapps
    If(
        varIsLocked,
        "Record Locked. Time expired.",
        "Time remaining: " & RoundDown(DateDiff(Now(), varLockExpiryTime, Seconds) / 60, 0) & "m " &
        Mod(DateDiff(Now(), varLockExpiryTime, Seconds), 60) & "s"
    )
    ```
*   **Form `DisplayMode` Property:** `If(varIsLocked, DisplayMode.View, DisplayMode.Edit)`
*   **Explanation:** This combination uses `DateAdd` to set a future deadline, `Now` and `DateDiff` to continuously check against it with a timer, and `Mod` to format a countdown timer, creating a sophisticated locking mechanism.
